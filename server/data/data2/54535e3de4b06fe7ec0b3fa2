Superheroes bring extra sparkle to city fireworks THE excitement is building as Glasgow gets ready to celebrate Bonfire Night.More than 50,000 people are expected to converge on Glasgow Green for Scot-land's biggest firework display.On Wednesday the park will be open from 4pm and the fireworks will light up the sky to the soundtrack of superhero songs at 7.30pm.Lord Provost of Glasgow, Councillor Sadie Docherty, said: &quot;During the summer we celebrated Team Scotland's sporting heroes but our reputation as a great city also owes a great deal to the thousands of unsung heroes who do incredible work across our communities.&quot;The theme is super-heroes and we want to say thank you to all of them.&quot;The Scottish Association for Mental Health is running a Guy Fawkes firewalk at St Enoch Square and is encouraging daredevils to each raise at least &pound;130 for mental health charities.The event takes place on November 5 from 6.30pm until 9.30pm.Amid the big build up Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is warning of the dangers of holding firework displays.It is urging amateur pyrotechnic fans to watch any displays from a safe distance and be responsible and careful when handling any sparklers or fireworks.The first week of November is one of the busiest times of the year for SFRS crews, with the number of emergency calls typically rising by up to 40%.A spokesman for SFRS said: &quot;Everyone has a role to play in protecting themselves, their families and their communities.&quot;We have seen too many incidents where someone has suffered horrific injuries as a result of things going wrong.&quot;Careless and poorly built bonfires can threaten to set fire to neighbouring properties and also release toxic fumes that cause serious problems for people who have breathing conditions.&quot;
