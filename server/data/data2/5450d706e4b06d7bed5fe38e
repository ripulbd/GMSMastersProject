A family of four In Kirkintilloch have escaped with only minor injuries after an out-of-control car careered into their house.

The incident occurred on Monday night at around 7pm in Waterside Road where Lindy and Stephen Wright live with their children Holly and Scott.
A Vauxhall Astra, which appears to have approached Waterside Road from Bankhead Road, crashed through a fence and wall to end up fully inside the semi-detached house’s living room.
It’s understood that two people were taken to hospital but police say there were no “serious or significant injuries”.
On Tuesday morning a tarpaulin had been placed over the huge hole in the wall, with the car remaining inside the house and a police car stationed outside.
One resident said: “You see them speeding up and down Bankhead Road all the time. We’re always saying that it’s going to end up in tragedy.
“When I saw the police cars last night I instantly thought the worst but thankfully everybody seems to be ok. It’s a real blessing.”
