LAUGHING children kicking a ball and dogs barking in a park couldn't mask the poverty created by high levels of unemployment in a sprawling area of Glasgow which had been shunned by the business world. Glasgow Fort at 10: Mall that brought fresh life to the East End LAUGHING children kicking a ball and dogs barking in a park couldn't mask the poverty created by high levels of unemployment in a sprawling area of Glasgow which had been shunned by the business world.Easterhouse was desperate for a jobs lifeline and it came in the shape of transformed parkland which became a bustling mega retail hub five miles east of the city centre.Glasgow Fort is celebating its 10th birthday and so too are almost 2000 locals who work in the stores, eateries and cinema which have all helped repair the reputation of the area over the last decade.It was born out of necessity when city politicians rcognised there was an urgent need to create employment for families caught in a poverty trap with little or no hope of escape.Auchinlea Park in Easterhouse was the key. Ninety aces of parkland were sold by the city council to the private sector after pledges were given of of work for local people with the creation of Britain's first shopping park next to a motorway.And the promises were kept. Almost 100 traders operate from a shopping mall that's shaped like a horse shoe.They employ a combined workforce of 2500 staff, and around 1700 live in or near Easterhouse.Mall bosses work hand in glove with Jobs and Business Glasgow to try to improve access to employment opportunities, especially for those living in the area.The organisation's chairman, Councillor Jonathan Findlay, said: &quot;Glasgow Fort is a crucial employer locally and its management team takes that responsibility seriously.&quot;We are proud to work alongside Glasgow Fort to provide opportunities for the local pool of talent.&quot;Glasgow Fort has proven itself to be fully committed to its pledge of supporting residents in the local community.&quot;Congratulations to Glasgow Fort on 10 successful years, and I look forward to seeing the results of us continuing to work in partnership.&quot;Glasgow Fort cost &pound;140million and began trading in October, 2004.More than 100million shoppers have visited the Fort over the last 10 years and have spent a whopping &pound;5billion.And Glasgow Fort was the first mall in Scotland to pioneer midnight shopping in the run-up to Christmas.It was introduced in 2005 and the mall, which is open until 10pm during the week, continues to be the country's leading late night shopping destination.Phil Goodman has been managing the Fort since the autumn day launch a decade ago.He said: &quot;Our innovative approach secured our position as one of the country's leading shopping and leisure destinations pretty quickly, and we are continuously striving to build on that and evolve for our stores, staff and customers.&quot;The Easterhouse mall draws a lot of its customers not just from Glasgow but communities from the surronding area and especially from shoppers who access the city from the east when driving to Glasgow.Gordon Matheson reckons it has become a firm favourite over the years.The city council leader said: &quot;Glasgow Fort is one of the city's premier and best loved shopping malls, having welcomed over 100 million shoppers since it first opened its doors to the public back in 2004.&quot;Its fantastic mix of shops and restaurants and its excellent transport links have helped make it hugely popular with shoppers from not only Glasgow but across west central Scotland.&quot;Its contribution to the local economy cannot be underestimated, with around &pound;5billion being spent there in just 10 years.&quot;The Fort is also a major employer, with 2500 people currently working there.&quot;Councillor Matheson acknowledged its army of workers from the Easterhouse area and added: &quot;With many of those from the local area it is a mall with its roots firmly in the community.&quot;gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
