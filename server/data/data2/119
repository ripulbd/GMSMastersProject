Kids give race aces a head start HEAVY rain failed to dampen the spirits of thousands of Glasgow pupils when they took part in the Great Scottish Run schools' challenge.Around 3000 young people from across the city limbered up to race at Glasgow Green as a weekend of sporting events kicked off.The runners faced torrential downpours which left the ground sodden during yesterday's 1.5k challenge.But the youngsters gave it their all -and there were beaming faces at the start and finish.Ethiopian athlete Haile Gebrselassie, one of the world's top distance runners, started the race, along with Glasgow 2014 marathon winner Michael Shelley and London 2012 Olympic marathon star Tiki Gelana.David Hart from Nova International, organisers of the Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run, said the atmosphere at the Green was &quot;incredible&quot;.He added: &quot;Today's Super Saturday kids' events are now full so we are expecting over 3000 participants to take to George Square for the Family Mile, Junior Run and Toddler Dash.&quot;Finally, on Sunday, we will cap off a brilliant weekend with the 10k and half marathon, where the field will be led out by a phenomenal group of elite athletes including Haile Gebrselassie, Michael Shelley, Tiki Gelana and Edna Kiplagat.&quot;Hopefully the people of Glasgow will come out to support around 24,000 runners along the route or tune in at home from 10.30am when the half marathon will be broadcast live on BBC2.&quot;rachel.loxton@ eveningtimes.co.uk
