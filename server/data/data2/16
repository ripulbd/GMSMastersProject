AMONG some of the biggest names in pop and rock could be added to a wall of fame. Pop names will climb all the way to the stars AMONG some of the biggest names in pop and rock could be added to a wall of fame.A plea by the boss of the city's Garage venue for memories of bands which have played there has resulted in a &quot;staggering&quot; response.This year The Garage on Sauchiehall Street is celebrating its 20th anniversary.Owner Donald Macleod wanted to mark the occasion by having the names of every artist who had ever appeared inscribed on the club's stairway.Booking records went missing years ago so he turned to the Evening Times to ask our readers to jog his memory about the performers they had seen.So far he has been given more than 1500 names - so many Donald is going to have to find extra wall space.He said: &quot;So far we have 1560 names and they are still coming in. The response has been staggering.&quot;The club boss remembered many of the big stars who have performed in the venue, including One Direction, Prince, The Pretenders, Coldplay and Ian Dury, who made his last Scottish appearance with his band The Blockheads at the club.But he had forgotten Queen drummer Roger Taylor appeared a year after the death of singer Freddie Mercury.And it had slipped his mind that the venue also attracted Scots duo The Proclaimers and blind Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey, who starred in the film Roadhouse with Patrick Swayze.Donald said: &quot;Our stair wall is massive but we are going to have to run the names all the way up to the attic.&quot;Work on the wall is expected to start in the next couple of weeks.vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
