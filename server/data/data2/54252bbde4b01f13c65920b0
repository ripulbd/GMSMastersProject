YOUNG entrepreneurs given a leg up the business ladder by a Commonwealth Games legacy project are reaping the benefits. Business whizz kids reaping benefit of Games street legacy YOUNG entrepreneurs given a leg up the business ladder by a Commonwealth Games legacy project are reaping the benefits.The Beyond the Finish Line project challenged 16 to 30-year-olds to find social enterprise solutions to the issue of high street and town centre decline.Fifteen people were chosen to take the baton for business in the challenge co-ordinated jointly by Firstport, the social enterprise start-up agency, and Icecream Architecture.After just six months of nurturing and support, the young entrepreneurs have flown the nest and have turned their dream of running their own company into reality and a success.They came up with exciting initiatives including a youth culture magazine, an upcycling enterprise, an illustration company, confidence workshops for young mothers and a community cinema.Julia Martin and Harriet Steele, both 23, always wanted to run their own magazine celebrating Glasgow talent and getting them on an international platform but didn't have the backing until they pitched their idea to Beyond the Finish Line and were chosen to run with it.Now their fledgling business has gone from strength to strength with thousands of copies of their first quarterly magazine In Bloom was distributed throughout Berlin, New York, LA, Paris, Amsterdam, Australia and Canada.Within days of hitting the streets of Glasgow it was a sell-out and they are now getting ready to launch their second issue in November.Julia said: &quot;The quarterly magazine is a celebration of the talent in Glasgow- artists working in the city doing amazing things.&quot;We wanted to put all these artists from music, fashion, photography and literature on an international platform.&quot;Launching our own magazine is all we've ever wanted to do but I never imagined it would happen so soon. I thought maybe we'd reach our goal in our 30s but to have our magazine sold all over the world by 23 is unbelievable.&quot;It's a dream come true and we can't believe it has gone this far so quickly.&quot;We couldn't have done it without the support of Beyond the Finish Line.&quot;They are now looking forward to opening their new premises in Glasgow's Bothwell Street in a few months.Drama teacher Tara Stewart, 26, is about to open her Burds of a Blether business offering drama and confidence workshops for adults at Ledgowan Tenants Hall in Maryhill thanks to help from Beyond the Finish Line and soon she'll be branching out to help children too.The mum-of-one said: &quot;This was something I had always wanted to do but I didn't know how to go about it. I didn't have the resources and contacts I have now.&quot;The help and support I've had has been invaluable. It has given me more confidence, ironically, through the process.&quot;Other success stories include Treemendus set up by Sophie Steele and Shauna Gray to encourage more people to recycle unwanted furniture.janice.burns @eveningtimes.co.uk
