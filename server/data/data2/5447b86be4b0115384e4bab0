THE paint and polish manufacturers have a long and storied history, starting out in 1877 as a print manufacturer. Made in Glasgow: Smith & Rodger a polished act after 136 years of family business - Daily Record A FAMILY manufacturing business still going strong after 136 years seems a quaint concept in the age of internet start-ups and redundancy packages.
But Glasgow polish and paint manufacturers Smith &amp; Rodger have proved a long-term bet for success.
The firm were established in 1877 by John Smith and Daniel Rodger as a paint manufacturer.
Today, Smith &amp; Rodger is managed by Rodger’s grandson, Ian McAslan, who said: “The primary key to our success is our ability to change the firm as and when the market determined.
“Forty per cent of our business comes directly from Glasgow. We haven’t moved from the site since 1902, so everyone knows we are here.
“What sets us apart from our competition is that we manufacture here, we are the only company that make these products in Scotland and that gives us better profit margins.
“Most companies just sell the product. I want to keep manufacturing for as long as possible. To stop manufacturing the product would take the soul out of it.”
 McAlsan retains much of the business nous of his great grandfather. Rodger  would famously make a noise to announce his arrival, in&nbsp; case an employee was not doing his work. 
Handing out bonus awards in the early 1920s, he would explain the move was to enable employees to share in the firm’s prosperity, adding that he hoped it would be wisely used – and never in a public house.
