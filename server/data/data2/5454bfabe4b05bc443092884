 Kilmarnock striker Michael Ngoo will begin a lengthy absence by missing Saturday's Scottish Premiership meeting with Dundee. 
 Captain Manuel Pascali is suspended but goalkeeper Craig Samson may return from a broken toe. 
 Willie Dyer is back in the Dundee squad following a knee injury but Craig Wighton is a doubt after picking up a knock in that match. 
 Kyle Letheren, Peter MacDonald, Simon Ferry and Luka Tankulic remain out. 
  Kilmarnock defender Lee Ashcroft:  &quot;Right now I'm our only real back-up centre-half. 
 &quot;It's frustrating because while I'm ticking over playing reserve games, I'd prefer to go out and get involved in some matches that really mean something. 
 &quot;At my age I need to be playing first-team football to keep improving. 
 &quot;But I've got my chance this weekend and it is down to myself to take it.&quot; 
  Dundee manager Paul Hartley:  &quot;I think we've got a good points tally. 
 &quot;If we keep getting 16 points every quarter then we'll be more than ok. We've just got to keep the hard work going. 
 &quot;I've been pleased with the players we've brought in. We've had to bring a lot in over the summer and we think they've gelled well pretty quickly and we expect more to come from them.&quot;
