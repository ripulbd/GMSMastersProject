FORMER servicemen and women are being given a helping hand into higher education. Ex-Forces staff get jobs help FORMER servicemen and women are being given a helping hand into higher education.Glasgow Caledonian University is working with the Armed Forces, three city colleges and Glasgow's Helping Heroes to launch a Learning Partnership. The initiative will help them into employment through further and higher education.Lecturer Jim Castle, from the university's School Of Engineering and the Built Environment, will chair the partnership.He said: &quot;Those leaving early from the Armed Services, in particular, might not have had a great experience at school and may not have anticipated ever continuing their education.&quot;However, after even a short time in the Forces, they will have acquired practical knowledge and skills that will be a good foundation for future studies in a wide range of subjects, ranging from construction to IT, for example.&quot;Our links with HM Forces and Help for Heroes mean we can reach those who may be considering a return to education and can analyse how their experience can best be built upon.&quot;The university project will work with City of Glasgow, Glasgow Kelvin and Glasgow Clyde to provide a choice of educational opportunities to service leavers. Some will enter at university level, while others will start on a pre-college foundation, NC, HNC or HND course with the potential to proceed to university.The initiative has been welcomed by the Commander of the British Army in Scotland.Brigadier Paul Harkness said: &quot;The Armed Forces run the largest apprenticeship scheme in the UK, producing highly trained and experienced personnel.&quot;However, the move between military life and civilian life is not always straightforward.&quot;Caledonian University has stepped forward to assist in the transition through its Learning Partnership, accrediting past experience in lieu of formal academic qualifications, so providing future employers with a better understanding of the service leaver's abilities, skills and competencies.&quot;The broad range of courses on offer further enhances the opportunities for service leavers to improve themselves personally and professionally.&quot;catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk
