Glasgow women on top of the parties SHOULD Nicola Sturgeon, as expected, take over at the helm of the SNP, it would mean there three largest political parties in Scotland are led by Glasgow women MSPs.Pollok MSP Johann Lamont has been in charge of Scottish Labour since taking over from Iain Gray in the aftermath of the heavy defeat in the 2011 Holyrood election, and Glasgow MSP Ruth Davidson took charge of the Scottish Conservatives at the same time.While Margaret Thatcher remains the only woman ever to have led a UK political Party, Scotland has already had four women leading its parties. Ms Sturgeon if elected, would become the fifth.Ms Davidson took over from Annabel Goldie and Wendy Alexander was briefly leader of the Labour Holyrood party.It would also mean that four of the five Holyrood parties are led by Glasgow MSPs with Patrick Harvie leading the Scottish Greens, although his position is officially co-convener.The three women have already faced each other at First Ministers Question when Alex Salmond has been otherwise engaged.
