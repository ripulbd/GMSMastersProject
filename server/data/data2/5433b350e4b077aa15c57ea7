Hard graft the basis for Thistle win - Alan Archibald  Partick Thistle's 3-1 Scottish Premiership win over Motherwell was built on hard graft, argues the team's manager Alan Archibald. 
 &quot;I thought the lads worked ever so hard to win the second balls and do the ugly side of the game,&quot; the Jags boss told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;I thought we let ourselves down badly last week with the performance. 
 &quot;We didn't work hard enough and today we did do that and it allowed us to go and play and score some good goals.&quot; 
 Those goals came from Stuart Bannigan, Kris Doolan and Stephen O'Donnell, the latter after Lionel Ainsworth had pulled one back for Stuart McCall's struggling team. 
 “I thought the lads worked ever so hard to win the second balls and do the ugly side of the game” 
 &quot;It probably came at a time when we were dominating,&quot; Archibald said of Ainsworth's long-range strike. 
 &quot;The lads reacted really well. Motherwell are a hard team to defend against. They've got a lot of big guys and they put the ball in the box but credit to them [the Jags players] today, they held out. 
 &quot;It was a great team performance. 
 &quot;It's a great three points and gives us confidence. We go into the international break. 
 &quot;The lads have got a couple of days off and we get back to hard work and we go up to Tannadice with some confidence.&quot;
