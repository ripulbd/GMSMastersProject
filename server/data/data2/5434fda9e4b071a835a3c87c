YOU CAN almost taste the fear in the room. The heat is Zilli on in Aldo's chef test YOU CAN almost taste the fear in the room.Ten fine chefs from all over Scotland, whittled down from hundreds of hopefuls, are waiting expectantly for Aldo Zilli to start cooking.In a side room, Aldo - most famous for his legendary London seafood restaurant Zilli Fish - says he knows how they feel.&quot;It is a competition, they are nervous,&quot; he smiles. &quot;I have been there. What I am looking for is confidence, skills and techniques, knowledge of the ingredients and most of all, enjoyment.&quot;He pauses. &quot;But be scared too. That's good.&quot;The morning session, at The Cook School in Kilmarnock, is one of two Aldo will be judging.In the afternoon he will head to Clydebank for the best pizza final, which also features several Glasgow names including Toni's Pizzeria, Italian Kitchen, Il Pavone and the Battlefield Rest.The winners of all categories will be announced at a glittering awards dinner, hosted by Des Clarke, on October 26 at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow.Warren Paul, CEO for the Scottish Italian Awards, says: &quot;We are delighted with the response to this year's awards and having Aldo on board shows how serious the competition is.&quot;Aldo takes his place in the kitchen and within what seems like seconds has whipped up fresh pasta, cooked it in red wine and added pancetta and a pecorino cheese mousse.There are helpful tips along the way (&quot;keep your rolling pin in the freezer overnight&quot;, for example) and a minor calamity when a helpful assistant puts an onion Aldo has dropped on the floor back on the chopping board. &quot;Never, ever, EVER, put food which has been on the floor back on the board,&quot; he says, with icy calm, swapping the board and sending a look in the assistant's direction which would wither fresh herbs.With tension mounting, the chefs taste the finished dish and then return to their own workstations to begin cooking. Aldo moves among them, chatting to them all about their own restaurants and experience.&quot;It's good to see women involved,&quot; he says afterwards, commenting on the two female chefs who have made it to the final 10 - Daniela Cocchia, from Osteria in North Berwick, and Claire Rinaldi, from Primo Piano in Dumfries.&quot;There is a great deal of talent in Scotland. I love the country, I have many Scottish friends.&quot;But I think the UK as a whole has not yet seen the variety of Italian cooking that exists.ITALIAN cooking is vast - there are wide regional variations and most exist because grandmother has passed down recipes to mamma, to child.&quot;In the next five years, I think we will see much more of this regional variety coming to Britain.&quot;As each chef completes the dish, he or she takes it through to Aldo for tasting.He gives little away, although at one point he admits he is &quot;a little disappointed no-one is talking my language&quot;.&quot;I don't mean Italian, I mean the language of food,&quot; he adds.&quot;But they seem nervous, so that could be it.&quot;There are a couple of hairy moments - Aldo discovers a piece of onion skin in one dish, and another chef has reduced the red wine so much it has almost disappeared - but generally, the chefs are confident they have done their best.&quot;It's difficult - you are nervous, you are not in your own kitchen - but it was okay,&quot; smiles Mariano Russo, owner of La Fiorentina. &quot;We are chefs, used to working under pressure.&quot;Chris Rouse, of Celino's, agrees.&quot;It's great to see other chefs like Aldo in action and to meet chefs from all over the country.&quot;He grins: &quot;I'm glad it's done, and I'm feeling pretty relaxed.&quot;I think it went well.&quot;ann.fotheringham@ eveningtimes.co.uk
