Thanks to this, I will achieve an SVQ3 in carpentry and joinery and will be a qualified joiner when I'm 22.&quot;Jordan Turner, also 18, started his apprenticeship in joinery earlier this year.Jordan, from Knightswood, said: &quot;I've always wanted to be a joiner and enjoy practical work. I'm looking forward to becoming a joiner.&quot;I think I will be able to complete other qualifications while I'm here and hope to complete an advanced craft or an HNC.&quot;There are definitely lots of opportunities for me.&quot;City Building runs one of Britain's largest apprenticeship programmes and operates two award-winning centres - Queenslie Training Centre and The Skills Academy in Laurieston.
