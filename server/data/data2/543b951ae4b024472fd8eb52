From food banks to poor life expectancy, Glasgow is at the forefront of the battle to combat hardship. Challenge to break city's poverty cycle From food banks to poor life expectancy, Glasgow is at the forefront of the battle to combat hardship.This week's Poverty Challenge aims to highlight that battle and tackle poverty head-on.In the first of a series of reports, Political Correspondent STEWART PATERSON looks at the dramatic difference in life expectancy between the people who live in two very different parts of the city.BORN just five miles apart, baby boys in two areas of Glasgow will have dramatically different life expectancies.They could be born in the same hospital in the centre of the city but then go home just a few miles in opposite directions to two different worlds.While on average a boy in Bridgeton will be lucky to reach retirement age, a Jordanhill boy can expect to have more than 10 years collecting his pension.According to Scottish Government health research, in Bridgeton the life expectancy for males is 61.9 years, while for Jordanhill it is 75.8 years.Audit Scotland research has shown it is not just the length of life but the quality of life that is widely different between those in deprived and affluent areas. Its report into health inequalities states health and life expectancy worsens as deprivation levels increase.Low birth-weight and lung disease are higher in deprived areas, as are high blood pressure and higher cholesterol.While life expectancy has increased, the gap between rich and poor has not narrowed.The report says: &quot;Between 2000 and 2010 the average life-expectancy of men living in the least-deprived areas remained around 11 years higher than in the most deprived areas. For women [thegap] increased from 6.5 years to 7.5 years.&quot;The gap in Glasgow is illustrated by the Argyll train line running from west to east through the city centre.Along the seven stops from Jordanhill heading east average life expectancy reduces dramatically for each stop until Bridgeton.And yesterday, trade unionists took to the streets on two wheels to highlight the gap and call for action to tackle inequality and poverty.The Clarion Cycle Club pedalled along the route campaigning along the way.Jen McCarey, Unison organiser and member of the Clarion cycling club, said: &quot;Living in a deprived area means you're more much likely to be unwell than anyone living in an affluent area.&quot;This will get worse with the next set of welfare cuts taking &pound;4.5billion out of the pockets of the poorest families.&quot;Around 50,000 more &shy;children will end up living in poverty by 2020.&quot;We are cycling to say: 'End this shocking gap between rich and poor in our city, let's ensure that everyone starts life on an equal footing. Let's start by building a fairer healthier city for all Glaswegians.'&quot;The event is the first during Challenge Poverty Week, co-ordinated by the Poverty Alliance in Glasgow.The high number of men dying before retirement age in the city is a key theme of the week as it illustrates inequality and captures a range of poverty-related issues that lead to an early death.Peter Kelly, director of the Poverty Alliance, said: &quot;This is an excellent start to &shy;Challenge Poverty Week 2014. In 2012, the gap in life expectancies between Glasgow's least and most affluent areas was 11 years for men, and eight for women.&quot;Scotland has the second-highest working-age mortality rate in Europe and more work needs to be done to improve this.&quot;Tackling poverty and closing this gap has benefits for all of society.&quot;All children deserve the best start in life.&quot;The life-expectancy gap is so great that the World Health Organisation has investigated.It found that while deprivation was a factor, the life expectancy in the poorest parts of Glasgow was worse than in equally deprived areas in other UK cities such as Manchester and Liverpool.Much blame has been laid at the door of alcohol abuse and high smoking rates but when he was Scotland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Harry Burns said that is only part of the problem.In a report on the so-called Glasgow Effect he said there was more to the problem than deprivation and risk behaviour.He said people felt they had no control over their lives and that improvements in poorer areas were not as good as those among better-off peopleHe said: &quot;The key to the next phase in improving health overall is to bring the rate of improvement in lower socio-economic areas to match that in the most affluent parts of society.&quot;stewart.paterson@eveningtimes.co.uk
