Music Hall marketing manager Andy Kite said: “We are aware of the prices that these tickets are being sold for and we have looked in to it.
“When you buy a ticket for a show here it is generally non-refundable and non-resalable, but this is unfortunately something we’re unable to do much about.”
Ticketmaster said while it doesn’t actually own any of the tickets listed on Get Me In they are covered by the so-called “fan guard” guarantee.
This makes seven promises that fans can buy briefs for gigs with peace of mind.
A spokesman added: “All tickets are listed by sellers at prices they set.”
