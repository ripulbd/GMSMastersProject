THE family of murdered city businesswoman Moira Jones are planning another fundraising event just days after the success of a charity run in the park where her body was found. Moira Ball will help families THE family of murdered city businesswoman Moira Jones are planning another fundraising event just days after the success of a charity run in the park where her body was found.Moira's mum, Bea, has been busy organising the annual Moira Fund Ball, which will be held on Saturday, November 1, at Glasgow University Union.The retired teacher put out an invitation to our readers to join her and her family for the big night, which costs &pound;45 each or &pound;450 for a table of 10 for a three-course meal, live music, holiday prize draw and an auction.She is hoping for a similar response to the success of the run in Queen's Park.More than 350 people gathered for a 5k at Queen's Park in Glasgow last Sunday to celebrate Moira's life and raise money for her charity.The event raised &pound;7000 and money is still coming in.Moira, 40, was abducted yards from her home in May 2008 and then raped and murdered.Her killer, Marek Harcar, was a career criminal, with 13 previous convictions for violence and theft.The Slovakian is serving a minimum 25-year jail sentence after being found guilty in 2009.Last night Bea said: &quot;Moira's Run was just fantastic. It exceeded all expectations.&quot;The Moira Fund has had four requests for help already this week and it is wonderful to know we are able to help so many desperate families thanks to the efforts of so many.&quot;I know that many families will be helped as a result of the run but one family in particular is being helped directly because of the Evening Times' coverage of Moira's Run and The Moira Fund.&quot;It was read by the founder of the Glasgow-based charity, DAYNA (Death abroad - you are not alone), who was concerned that a very traumatised mum they were supporting was not in a position to get the counselling she so desperately needed.&quot;DAYNA contacted us, we had a chat and the course of sessions needed is already underway. We are all pleased about that.&quot;&quot;We now have our Moira Fund Ball to look forward to and that is only days away.&quot;It is always a very friendly event, with a lovely meal and great music, and there are still some tickets available.&quot;We'd love to hear from any Evening Times rsaders who'd like to attend. They can be sure of a warm welcome.&quot;Tickets are available on 01889 207041.janice.burns@ eveningtimes.co.uk
