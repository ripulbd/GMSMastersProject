Website is set to help West Dunbartonshire community have easy access to information on disabled sport activities in the area West Dunbartonshire Council launch website to help boost disability sports - Daily Record  A new website has been launched to provide people living with a disability in West Dunbartonshire with information on local sports activities within the community. 
The project was driven by West Dunbartonshire Council with initial funding provided by the Big Lottery Fund.
 Supported by Scottish Disability Sport and designed by Glasgow agency reflexblue, the website will provide people in West Dunbartonshire and all over Scotland with details of local clubs and organisations with information on physical activity sessions and events for people with a disability such as swimming, gymnastics, football, athletics and judo. 
West Dunbartonshire Council chief executive Joyce White was joined last week by visually impaired bowler Robert Conway, who won a silver medal in the Mixed Pairs at the Commonwealth Games, to help launch the website in West Dunbartonshire.
 Joyce said: “This initiative was devised by West Dunbartonshire’s sports development co-ordinator Tommi Orismaa, who realised through his work with disabled people in our community the difficulties they faced in accessing information on the sporting opportunities available. 
“The Commonwealth Games has inspired many people to take up sport and this website improves access to sporting activity for our disabled residents by highlighting the clubs, groups and classes which are available locally and across Scotland.
