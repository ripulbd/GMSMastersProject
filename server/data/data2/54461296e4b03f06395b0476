Company moves into bigger office to meet growing demand from customers Translation business expands - Daily Record A translation business has moved to a bigger new office in Glasgow as demand for its services grows across Scotland.
Sam Bennett leads the Translation People's&nbsp; operations in Scotland serving clients in sectors ranging from oil and gas to banking and insurance, and manages some of the company’s largest accounts, including those of Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line, DHL, BG Group, Thales and Honeywell.
Translation projects range from manuals and websites to localised software and marketing materials.
The Glasgow team also recently translated a tour guide leaflet into French and German at the Glenmorangie distillery to improve the experience for overseas visitors.
Bennett said: “Our continued expansion over recent years meant we outgrew our old offices, and this move will really help us to further develop our services.
“The new offices are double the size of our former base in the city, and also feature a conference room which enables us to offer improved client meeting facilities.
“Looking ahead, I expect demand for our services to grow further as companies seek to take full advantage of the global marketplace.
Glasgow is one of four UK centres for The Translation People. The company has its headquarters in Greater Manchester and a presence in London and Birmingham.
