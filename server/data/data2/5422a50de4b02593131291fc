Grace Walker sat “shaking” at home after winning the prize on the &pound;100 Million Cash Spectacular Scratchcard at the weekend.
The 49-year-old buys a ticket from her local shop in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, every Saturday but needed her family to double-check the card before she could believe the outcome.
The &pound;1 million prize will be shared with her husband William and their three children - Siobhan, 28, Kevin, 27, and Michelle, 22.
Mrs Walker said: “My husband William was at work so I had no-one to check if it was real or not.
“It wasn’t until my daughter said, ‘Mum, you’ve won &pound;1,000,000’, that it sank in. I didn’t finish my coffee. I just sat there shaking until my husband came home.
“I buy a scratchcard from my local shop every Saturday because I enjoy the thrill of knowing that it could be me. But I still can’t believe it.”
Mrs Walker does not know how she will spend the winnings but has no plans to move away from their home town of Hamilton.
“I haven’t made up my mind yet,” she said. “But one thing is for sure I won’t be moving house. I’ve lived here for 30 years and I love it.”
The scratchcard was bought from the Fairhill Store in Buchan Street, Hamilton, on Saturday.
