Scottish comedian Billy Connolly has said there will be "hell to pay" if David Cameron does not honour his pledge of extra powers for Scotland. Scottish referendum: Billy Connolly warns David Cameron over pledges Scottish comedian Billy Connolly has said there will be &quot;hell to pay&quot; if David Cameron does not honour his pledge of extra powers for Scotland.
In the run-up to the independence referendum, the prime minister pledged more powers for Holyrood over areas such as tax and welfare.
SNP leader Alex Salmond claimed Westminster party leaders tricked people into voting No to independence.
Connolly said: &quot;If Mr Cameron keeps up his promises we should be okay.&quot;
&quot;If he doesn't there'll be all hell to pay,&quot; the comedian warned.
Scotland voted last week to stay in the United Kingdom.
Speaking at the London premiere of What We Did On Our Holiday, the Big Yin said: &quot;It's 50:50 - 50% of the country are delighted, 50% are disappointed. But Scotland will get used to the idea.&quot;
On the eve of the referendum vote, Connolly said he no longer lived in the country so he didn't have the opportunity - or enthusiasm - to vote.
Speaking at the film premiere, he added: &quot;Scotland is kind of fed up - no matter what they vote for they get what England votes for.
&quot;I think that was driving the whole thing. So if you vote to stay together, you get (Ukip leader) Nigel Farage and all that baloney and baggage.&quot;
