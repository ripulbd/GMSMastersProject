BEREAVED families will never have to suffer the agony of not knowing the location of their child's remains, council bosses have pledged. Council in vow to avoid baby ashes scandal repeat BEREAVED families will never have to suffer the agony of not knowing the location of their child's remains, council bosses have pledged.A Glasgow City Council committee has published its plans to ensure there will be no repeat of the baby ashes scandal.The move comes in the wake of a nationwide inquiry into missing infant and baby remains, led by Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini.Staff at Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh disposed of stillborn and dead babies' remains and told parents there would be no ashes left to scatter following cremation.Glasgow set up an Infant &shy;Cremation Working Group to set down guidelines for the city's two crematoria, Linn and Daldowie.The group has highlighted six areas where improvements have been put in place.At both Glasgow City Council crematoria, ashes are now defined as all that remains following the cremation process, rather than just skeletal remains.As previously told in the Evening Times, hospitals and funeral directors have been told of this change in definition and been advised to ensure bereaved parents are made aware of this.In conjunction with that move, the council now uses baby trays for all infant and baby cremations at both Linn and Daldowie Crematoria.It is hoped this will increase the chance that all ashes are properly collected following the cremation.New processes have been put in place to make sure senior management are thoroughly aware of current cremation documentation used in the &shy;crematoria with the processes reviewed annually.A review of all documentation used by Glasgow City Council crematoria has been carried out with forms and paperwork revised to make sure they can be clearly and easily understood by all cremation applicants.Bereavement management from the council have also met with Funeral Directors and NHS Managers to make sure that those who are dealing with members of the public can properly describe &shy;processes to bereaved parents.Councillor Frank McAveety, convener of the council's Sustainability and the Environment Committee, said: &quot;Glasgow City Council welcomes the Infant Cremation Commission's interpretation of ashes as 'all that remains following the cremation process'.&quot;This provides absolute &shy;clarity for crematoria, funeral directors and hospitals.&quot;Crematoria staff have now been given a clear definition of what should be returned to &shy;bereaved families.&quot;The council, with immediate effect, began to use Dame Elish Angiolini's definition from her report into Mortonhall and moved away from the more general definition of the Federation of Burial and &shy;Cremation Authorities.&quot;This clarification makes it very likely that we will return any ash to bereaved families, where they request it.&quot;The working group is made up of senior officers from Glasgow City Council and chaired by the Executive Director of Land &amp; Environmental Services.
