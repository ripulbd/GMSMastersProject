ANAS SARWAR: Anas Sarwar and Nicola Sturgeon explain why they will cast their votes for opposing campaigns ANAS SARWAR:TOMORROW Scotland goes to the polls in the biggest political decision any of us will ever make.It's an irreversible decision, one there is no going back on and the impact of which will last for generations.And the choice tomorrow is clear: a No Vote for a stronger Scotland with faster, better and safer change. More powers over tax and welfare for the Scottish Parliament with a clear and agreed timetable for delivery which starts this Friday.Or the risks of separation laid bare every day, with clear risks to jobs, to pensions, to mortgages and to our cherished NHS under Alex Salmond's plans.Despite polls opening in less than 24 hours, still no answers to the big questions the people of Scotland have been asking for months now.While Alex Salmond continues to spin his way around Scotland in his helicopter, it's the workers, the pensioners and the NHS who will pay the price if he has got his sums wrong.Despite everything that is at stake and after the longest campaign in history, with 1000s of journalists from around the world arriving in Scotland, Alex Salmond still refuses to give us answers to the most fundamental questions about what separation would mean to every family in Scotland.Instead he tries to shout down experts and journa-lists and sends his activists to the BBC HQ, calling for the sacking of respected journalists who ask the hard questions we all need answers to.Every major financial institution has warned of the risks to the 200,000 jobs in Scotland's financial services industry, super-markets have warned of the risk to higher prices and just one opinion poll showing Yes in the lead knocked billions off the value of our pension funds.Alex Salmond might think these risks are a price worth paying. We don't.It's not just an argument of the head that makes a No vote the right thing to do. The emotional argument is a strong one. We share many of the struggles of friends and family in other parts of the UK.Scots don't do walking away, we stand shoulder to shoulder with workers from Liverpool or Manchester, Cardiff and Belfast. That is why we are making the positive case for Scotland, voting to remain part of the UK.We know that being part of the UK is best for pensions, with every UK taxpayer guaranteeing your pension.We know being part of the UK is best for jobs and business, with Scottish comp-anies selling twice as much to the rest of the UK than they do to the rest of the world combined.We know it is best for the NHS, with funding protected by the Scottish Parliament.And we know it means we can have the best of both worlds.A stronger Scottish Parliament with new powers guaranteed over tax and welfare but still being backed up by the strength and security of being part of the UK.It's clear, voting No means a stronger Scotland, with jobs across the country protected and our NHS secured.NICOLA STURGEON:TODAY, Scotland stands on the cusp of history. We are now a matter of hours from the referendum -and I'm more confident than ever that the people of Scotland are going to say Yes.The sheer energy and enthusiasm of the Yes campaign has already changed Scotland for the better. The dramatic swings to Yes in recent weeks are a result of people power -across Glasgow and in towns throughout the West of Scotland, communities are realising the power of making their voices heard.What a contrast to the scaremongering of the No campaign - which, we are told, even saw supermarket bosses summoned to Downing Street so David Cameron could pressure them into saying prices would rise in an independent Scotland.Despite Westminster's efforts, we have seen a flourishing of national self-confidence. No-one else will do a better job and no-one else cares as much about our country than the people who live and work here.It's time to say goodbye to the days when decisions about our lives were made by remote Westminster governments - often, like now, Tory-led governments that we didn't even elect. With a Yes vote we'll always get the governments we vote for.That means we can stop paying to the &pound;100billion cost of a new generation of nuclear weapons on the Clyde and invest in childcare instead.We can protect our NHS from the impact of Tory privatisation, as former Chief Medical Officer Sir Harry Burns has pointed out.South of the Border Labour is rightly warning about the Conservatives' privatisation of the NHS.They say there is an increase in charging for care and they say another few years of Tory rule will destroy the values of a publicly-run and owned health service. And Labour MPs in Scotland, unions and others are warning about the knock-on effect of Westminster health cuts on the budget for health here.So despite what Labour leaders are saying during this campaign, the Labour Party itself has made it crystal-clear that the Tory threat is real.With a Yes vote we have control of our budget. That means it won't be George Osborne making the decisions about funding for our public services. We can protect ourselves from the fall-out from Tory privatisation by taking control of our finances.Everyone now accepts that we are one of the world's richest countries. We are among the 20 wealthiest countries per head in the world - ahead of the UK.So the great issue is not whether Scotland is wealthy enough to be independent. It's why so many people in Scotland don't feel the benefit of that wealth.The result of decades of Westminster decisions is that the gap between rich and poor is among the highest in the developed world.More and more people in this campaign are finding out about Scotland's wealth and are waking up to the opportunities we'll have with a Yes vote to use economic powers to make the most of that wealth.That's one of the main reasons people are switching from a No vote, and why Yes will win tomorrow.
