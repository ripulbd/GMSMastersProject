 However, the deal for the 31-year-old, out of contract since leaving Motherwell at the end of last term, will be reviewed in January. 
 &quot;It's no secret that recent injuries have left us short of options,&quot; manager Tommy Wright told the club website.&nbsp; 
 &quot;He brings a wealth of experience at the very top level and has the ability to provide us with that little spark.&quot; 
 McFadden, capped 48 times by Scotland, is due to play in Wednesday's Development League game against Aberdeen at McDiarmid Park and Wright hopes he can fill the void left by the injury to striker Steven MacLean. 
 &quot;He's signed for the remainder of the season but there's a little bit of a gamble on the part of both the club and the player,&quot; he explained. 
 &quot;However, we've held very open and honest discussions with James. Both parties will review things in January and if it is working out for everyone then he will be here until the end of the campaign.&quot; 
 McFadden had been keeping fit with Partick Thistle since his Motherwell release and spent Monday and Tuesday training with St Johnstone. 
 He came through the youth ranks at Motherwell and returned in February 2013 after being released by Sunderland. 
 McFadden moved to Everton from the Steelmen for &pound;1.2m in 2003 and joined Birmingham City five years later for a fee of about &pound;5m. 
 Serious injury disrupted McFadden's career and he had a short spell back with the Toffees before joining Sunderland. 
 Last season, he made 30 appearances for Motherwell, scoring five goals.
