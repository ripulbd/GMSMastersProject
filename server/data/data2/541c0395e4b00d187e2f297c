POLICE in Glasgow probe more than 50 cases of animal cruelty and neglect a year, according to a Freedom of Information report. Cops reveal high level of pet neglect POLICE in Glasgow probe more than 50 cases of animal cruelty and neglect a year, according to a Freedom of Information report.Figures released from Police Scotland showed officers investigated 55 cases during 2013 and more than 300 in six years.The figures, covering the Glasgow area from 2008 to 2013, showed an average of 55 cases each year, and exactly 55 in 2013.Of the 2013 cases, 36 resulted in court cases and 19 were unresolved. No details of the cases have been revealed but a Scottish SPCA spokeswoman confirmed that one of the most recent to reach court involved a bearded dragon with its tail hacked off by a knife.A 33-year-old woman from Provanmill was sentenced at Glasgow Sheriff Court to 140 hours community service and a one year supervision order in February after she pled guilty to causing her three- year-old adult male bearded dragon, Mo, unnecessary suffering by failing to provide veterinary treatment for a severed tail.Animal charities warn the real cruelty and neglect figure will be much higher, with not all cases involving the police. Widlife crime, such as poisoning and badget baiting are particular examples as the charity struggles to get enough evidence for court action.Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn, of the Scottish SPCA, said the actual cruelty cases could be five times as high as official figures.He said it was easier to prove cases against domestic animals and registered livestock because the owners were usually traceable through microchips or documents.He said: &quot;It's easier if the case involves a dog, for example, because you know who owns it.&quot;We get between 170 to 190 cases a year across Scotland that are reported to the procurator fiscal but there could be 500 to 600, many of them involving wildlife crime, which are difficult to prove so they don't get to court.&quot;He said cases involving emaciated animals were of particular concern.Mr Flynn said: &quot;When you see large dogs to get to that point, it's particularly distressing as they will have gone through weeks of suffering.&quot;There is no excuse. If people genuinely can't afford to feed their pets they should contact us. We will never put a healthy animal down.&quot;victoria.brenan@eveningtimes.co.uk
