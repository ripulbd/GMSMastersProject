AXA said its annual claims data showed a 31 per cent decrease in all types of business crime across the UK, with a drop of as much as 63 per cent in some parts of Scotland.
The highest rate of crime claims was recorded in London’s WC postcode district, where businesses have a one in three chance of making a claim.
Kilmarnock was among the areas seeing the most dramatic improvement in the UK, with claims dropping 63 per in a year.
However, Paisley moved ahead of Edinburgh in Glasgow based on the number of claims.
Darrell Sansom, managing director at AXA Business Insurance, said: “Our figures suggest that the average business is now at lower risk of getting a brick through the window, being burnt to the ground by hooligans or facing a break-in.
“That’s great news, but we need to remember what it means if you are the one in twenty that does suffer a crime.”
