On the run thug linked to victim of gangland killing A GLASGOW fugitive is part of a criminal web linking him with some of the most feared gangland figures, the Evening Times can today reveal.Jonathan Kelly, Scotland's most wanted man, has been on the run for six weeks, since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.Today, a source close to the machete thug told how Kelly, 34, was friends with Kevin 'The Gerbil' Carroll.Notorious gangland figure Carroll was thought to be involved in a series of kidnappings dubbed &quot;alien abductions&quot;.Carroll, 29, from Possil, was gunned down in a supermarket carpark in Robroyston in January 2010.A source said: &quot;Kelly was good pals with Gerbil.&quot;Kelly's a well connected guy, he's got plenty of associates who will see him right.&quot;Carroll, suspected leader of the &quot;alien abduction squad&quot;, so-called because its victims insisted to police they had no memory of what happened to them, is said to have been on several hit-lists.Sources claimed Kelly had grown increasingly out of control and the underworld bosses he was working for believed he had become more trouble than he was worth.The insider added: &quot;They were actually glad when Kelly went back to jail.&quot;He was a major liability, a loose cannon.&quot;Detectives are desperate to capture Kelly, from Drumchapel, who went on the run after he was released from Low Moss Prison, near Glasgow.However, police admit there have been no positive sightings of Britain's most wanted man for six weeks.Despite high hopes for a breakthrough following a BBC Crimewatch appeal the inquiry appears to be no further forward.Kelly is believed to be armed and it is understood that, because of the risk he poses, firearms officers will be drafted in as soon as he is spotted.Police have repeatedly said Kelly is no danger to the public, but he was the focus of an armed siege in Boyd Street, Govanhill, just weeks ago.Crimestoppers is also offering a &pound;1000 reward in a bid to snare the violent serial offender.A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: &quot;Inquiries are continuing.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
