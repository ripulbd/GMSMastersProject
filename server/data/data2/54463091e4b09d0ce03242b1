 Third at the halfway stage, the 22-year-old finished the six-race event on 199 points, one clear of Belgium's Jolien D'Hoore, in Guadeloupe. 
 Katie Archibald, who won team pursuit gold with Trott earlier in the week, also collected her second win, with victory in the individual pursuit. 
 Britain ended the event with six gold medals, one silver and a bronze. 
 Trott's gold was perhaps the most thrilling. She won events four and five, the 500m time trial and flying lap to move level on points with D'Hoore. 
 The final event, the points race, saw both riders pick up points in the early sprints but Trott won the crucial final one on the line to take the title and match the double she won at last year's Euros, the 2012 World Championships and London Olympics 
 &quot;Really need to get out the habit of leaving everything to the last sprint!&quot; she wrote on Twitter.&nbsp; 
 &quot;But hey ho double European champion! Super happy.&quot; 
 Archibald, 20, beat Germany's Mieke Kroger by two seconds in the individual pursuit final, while fellow Briton, world champion Joanna Rowsell was fifth.
