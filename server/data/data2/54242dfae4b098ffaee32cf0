Popular deli shuts in Shawlands A POPULAR deli which has served a community for a decade has shut up shop.Deli 1901, in Skirving Street, Shawlands, shut around three weeks ago, leaving locals shocked.Businessman Colin Campbell, who also has a catering business, said he was forced to close because he could not keep the deli afloat.He said since the recession he had struggled to keep the large deli in profit. He now hopes to continue catering and open a smaller cake speciality shop.The deli, which sold sandwiches, cakes and drinks, as well as deli products, was a firm favourite with locals, workers and visitors to the area from elsewhere in Glasgow.Colin said: &quot;We couldn't keep it open anymore.&quot;We're supposed to be out of a recession but things aren't improving in Glasgow, or Shawlands.&quot;Shocked businesses in the Southside are hoping to see another deli in its place.Workers are now questioning how the area can attract more customers to stop independent businesses from closing.Colin said: &quot;The only thing that can really improve Shawlands is private business but in this day and age when the banks are not lending and the rates are so high that's just not possible.&quot;The council needs to look at ways of helping businesses - maybe by introducing holidays on rates, or rebates.&quot;Fiona McGreevy, who works in Cosgrove Care, said she hoped another cafe-style restaurant would take the place of Deli 1901. She said: &quot;We would like to see a deli there again if it reopens. That really helped bring footfall to the area.&quot;Gael Weir, another charity worker, said: &quot;We wouldn't want to see another takeaway. It really helped to have people sitting in and spending time in the street.&quot;Gillian Cobb, owner of retailer Butterfly Kisses, said she was worried that the lack of parking in Shawlands was pushing potential customers away. She said: &quot;We would like to see the council looking at introducing free parking between certain hours.&quot;There isn't enough parking so people are choosing to go to Silverburn instead of shopping local. This is a great area and we need to get more people to support businesses, but we need support from the council too.&quot;The calls came as the council continued a consultation on plans to develop Shawlands, which include proposals for a new civic square, an outdoor lighting project and designation of Shawlands Cross as a conservation area.They are asking for views from the community, and yesterday an open day was held at Langside Halls.A council spokesman said: &quot;Shawlands has for decades being one of Glasgow's leading destinations for people to shop, eat, drink and visit.&quot;Around five years ago, in recognition of the fact that such town centres need vision and investment, we began a major consultation to ensure the strengths of Shawlands were promoted and its weaknesses tackled.&quot;rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk
