'Spy' app can show parents youngsters' selfie images WORRIED parents are being urged to protect children from online predators - by snooping on their selfies.Amid a rise in youngsters sending sexually explicit pictures and messages, police in Glasgow are encouraging them to download a new 'spy' app.SelfieCop sends parents a copy of every photo or video taken on their child's smartphone. Creators said the aim is to make young people &quot;think more carefully&quot; about what they are snapping and sharing.Police Scotland recently launched a war on kids sending so-called 'sexts' and warned that thousands of teenagers have been blackmailed and bullied after 'selfies' sent in confidence were posted online.Officers in Maryhill recently visited Cleveden Secondary School to talk to pupils about internet safety and the &quot;dangers of selfies&quot;.A local police spokesman said: &quot;SelfieCop protects children from the dangers of sexting.&quot;Download this app and see what photos your child is sending to social media.&quot;SelfieCop works by emailing parents a copy of every photo or video taken on their child's smartphone or tablet.It includes photos and videos captured by popular social networks including SnapChat, Insta-gram, Facebook and Twitter.A recent study by the NSPCC reported that up to 40% of young people had been involved in 'sexting'.It also found that teenage girls in particular were facing pressure from classmates to provide sexually-explicit pictures of themselves.Developers behind the security device encourage parents to inform their children before installing the app. They say the aim is not for parents to spy on children, but to teach them to stay safe.Police Scotland officers warned pupils against sending out images that they wouldn't pass around school or show their mum or dad.The force's Stay Safe Online campaign aims to raise awareness of the risks and help children, parents, teachers and carers improve their knowledge and under-standing of how to keep children safe. Criminals can use the internet to pretend to be someone else, deceiving their victims.Launching the scheme, Detective Chief Inspector William Cravens said: &quot;We want to help children to enjoy the benefits of the internet by being able to stay safe online.&quot;All children and young people need to understand they should only share pictures online with friends, family and others they are happy should see them.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
