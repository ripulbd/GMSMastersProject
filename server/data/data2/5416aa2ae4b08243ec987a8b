WITH three days until the polling stations open, the leaders of both campaigns said they were confident of victory. Both sides confident of winning the battle WITH three days until the polling stations open, the leaders of both campaigns said they were confident of victory.With opinion polls showing the vote increasingly close, First Minister, Alex Salmond said Friday would be a day of celebration, while Better Together leader, Alistair Darling said Scotland wouldn't be bullied into voting Yes.Mr Salmond said in either circumstance the matter would be settled and Scotland must come together.He said if it was a No vote then the issues would be settled for a &quot;political generation&quot;, which he suggested was around 20 years.Mr Darling said he agreed that no-one wanted another referendum campaign.Both leaders appeared on television hoping the vote on Thursday will put the result beyond question.The First Minister said a majority of one vote was enough for independence and if not, then even if the SNP won a majority at Holyrood again he would not look to bring forward another referendum.He said: &quot;Harold Wilson famously said one vote is enough in a referendum but we're not aiming to win by one vote, we're aiming to achieve a substantial majority if we can.&quot;&quot;If you remember that previous constitutional referendum in Scotland, there was one in 1979 and then the next one was 1997. That's what I mean by a political generation.&quot;In my opinion, and it is just my opinion, this is a once in a generation opportunity for Scotland.&quot;&quot;That's my view. My view is this is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime, opportunity for Scotland.&quot;Mr Salmon also said after a Yes vote the Yes and No campaigns would no longer exist and could unite to achieve the best future for the country.He said: &quot;First and urgent business is to bring Scotland together, because on Friday after a Yes vote there will cease to be a Yes campaign and a No campaign, there will be a Team Scotland.&quot;I've said very clearly that I want into that Team Scotland as many voices as possible, people who have got something to offer and contribute. We need and have recruited specialists in a variety of fields, some extraordinary people with great things to contribute. Nobody has said no, incidentally.&quot;He said his campaign opponents would have a role in that process.Mr Darling said he agreed the matter had to be settled on Thursday.He said: &quot;The one point that I do agree with Alex Salmond is that I think on Thursday we've got to decide this for a generation.&quot;I don't know of anybody who actually wants to go through another two-and-a-half year referendum.&quot;As campaigners clashed last week in Glasgow city centre and controversy erupted over rival campaign events being disrupted by the other side, Mr Darling said he felt &quot;menaced&quot;.He added: &quot;I've been involved in political campaigning for about 35 years and I've never seen anything like this before.&quot;I think the majority of people, the quiet majority who are beginning to speak out, are not prepared to be bullied into accepting there's only one side here.&quot;The former Chancellor said people would not be pushed into accepting it was Scotland versus the UK and they would reject Mr Salmond's argument.He said: &quot;People in Scotland have yet to cast their votes - we've yet to reach this verdict,&quot; he said.&quot;I've said before this is going to go down to the wire but I think we will win because I don't think Scotland is going to get bullied into accepting something that it doesn't want.&quot;Very often when you listen to Alex Salmond talking it is almost like a contest between us and the rest of the UK. It isn't. Increasingly it looks like Salmond versus Scotland and I'll tell you what, Scotland's going to win.&quot;The two leaders expressed mutual respect and said after the vote there had to be reconcilliation.Mr Salmond said there were &quot;idiots&quot; on both sides of the campaign, but the vast majority had been taking part in an &quot;invigorating, empowering, enjoyable&quot; debate.He said: &quot;I've seen nothing like this in Western Europe, certainly in recent generations.&quot;He said Mr Darling was a &quot;first-rate politician&quot; who would be a welcome addition to Team Scotland in the event of a Yes vote.Mr Darling said the two men had a &quot;high-regard&quot; for each other and &quot;would always get on&quot;.
