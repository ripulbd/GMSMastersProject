PRE-teen drug users are being rushed to casualty units in Glasgow, according to a top Glasgow doctor. Doctor tells of injured kids who took drugs PRE-teen drug users are being rushed to casualty units in Glasgow, according to a top Glasgow doctor.Many of the children, who are as young as 12, have overdosed on illegal substances but some have suffered &quot;horrible&quot; injuries after jumping from windows.Dr Richard Stevenson, a specialist in emergency medicine based at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, said: &quot;The main bracket we see is early 20s but we are seeing more aged 12 upwards.&quot;The youngest patient I had was a 12-year-old. That was legal highs.&quot;We have also seen 15-year-olds presenting with ecstasy-type drug intoxications.&quot;I had to admit one to intensive care. She nearly died.&quot;We have seen people 50-plus presenting who are long-term heroin users.&quot;My eldest patient was a 62-year-old man who had a cocaine habit. He had a job but he was regular cocaine user.&quot;It's young students too. They are going on a night out and they are taking drugs intentionally.&quot;Doctors at accident and emergency wards categorise drug users based on the substances they have consumed.Dr Stevenson explained: &quot;When we see long-term drug users it's due to overdose and they require supportive therapy or antidotes.&quot;They are often turned around but we have treated people where they have had to go to intensive care because they are in danger of cardiac arrest or they have stopped breathing. With recreational drug users, the most common thing is abnormal behaviours.&quot;They are basically going off their head with agitation, confusion, aggression. On a Friday or a Saturday night in the Royal, there's a corridor - it's just a line of people waiting to be seen.&quot;Dr Stevenson said there are also &quot;marked social variations&quot;.He explained: &quot;The life-threatening toxicities that we see are often more socially deprived areas where they don't go to nightclubs.&quot;They have a party in their residences and consume multiple substances and then an ambulance is called because someone is found unresponsive.&quot;The people with jobs are the ones who are ecstasy and cocaine users.&quot;In the socially deprived areas they take more benzos and valium-type drugs and cannabis.&quot;Some who arrive at A&amp;E have suffered serious injuries due to behaviours associated with the substances they have consumed.Dr Stevenson said: &quot;We are finding it's not just poisonings from drugs.&quot;We are seeing people being knocked down because they are walking in front of traffic.&quot;Also, we have had a few pretty horrible cases of young people jumping out of windows and sustaining life-threatening injuries due to drug intoxication.&quot;They have fractured spines, fractured ankles, head injuries.&quot;One just jumped through a window for no reason.&quot;When he came in he was in a drug-induced psychosis.&quot;Dr Stevenson added: &quot;There's the drug driving aspect too. They are partying and they don't realise the drugs are still in their system and they still have an effect.&quot;People think they can get away with it.&quot;peter.swindon@eveningtimes.co.uk
