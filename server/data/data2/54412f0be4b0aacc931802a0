Haig Club has always been about friends coming together and that's what we wanted to reflect with the advert. It's as simple as that.&quot;Ritchie added: &quot;This project had so many elements that I find appealing; it's a film about good mates having an adventure and coming together for a celebration.&quot;It's set in the Highlands of Scotland, one of the most beautiful places I've visited. David is a good friend and we had a lot of fun making this together.&quot;It comes after the retired footballer celebrated the global launch earlier this month of the drink from Diageo, which is made at Scotland's oldest grain whisky distillery - Cameronbridge, in Fife.Beckham was joined by his wife Victoria at Gilmerton House in North Berwick, East Lothian, for a private dinner to toast its launch.
