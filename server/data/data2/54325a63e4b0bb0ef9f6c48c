COVERT internet investigators have been drafted in to catch armed robbers behind a £230,000 designer watch heist. Dragnet: Special web team probes city watch heist COVERT internet investigators have been drafted in to catch armed robbers behind a £230,000 designer watch heist.High-tech crime experts are trawling the web in a bid to identify and track down the four balaclava-clad men, armed with sledgehammers and axes, who smashed into Argyll Arcade.It is thought the gang - which targeted the arcade in daylight - may try to sell their haul online.Police said it was unlikely it would be sold in the UK, as no reputable trader would touch it.Undercover officers are spending hours combing watch and jewellery dealers' websites as the hunt for the stolen items continues.Stunned shoppers watched in terror as the armed thugs staged a brazen raid on jewellery shops in Buchanan Street almost two weeks ago.A police insider said: &quot;We're very confident inroads are being made and we'll get these guys sooner rather than later. Covert investigating officers are working on the case and the inquiry team has full internet investigation support.Meanwhile, uniformed and plain-clothed police have been carrying out investigations at the Arcade and the scene where a suspected getaway car was dumped.Last week, scores of motorists and pedestrians were quizzed by detectives hunting the axe-wielding raiders,. It took just 54 seconds to smash open window display cases at Argyll Arcade and escape with the haul of top-of-the-range watches.Police also revealed the car had been stolen from outside a house in Haddington, East Lothian just hours before the raid.After dumping it, it is thought the gang headed towards Edinburgh in a Vauxhall Combo van.Detective Inspector Alasdair Barlow, leading the investigation, has urged anyone with information to contact police. He said: &quot;Witness reports say that they drove at excessive speed from Queen Street, up Ingram Street and up to High Street, often driving on the wrong side of the road.&quot;However, we also know that they had access to a Vauxhall Combo van.&quot;I'd like to speak to anyone who may have seen a Vauxhall Combo or the Volkswagen being driven in the Glasgow area just prior to the robbery and just after.&quot;The gang's getaway was captured on video by shoppers who were told they would be killed unless they moved. One thug shouted in an East coast accent: &quot;Out the way or I will kill you all.&quot;They smashed its way into four jewellers' shops - Rox, Mappin and Webb, Laing the Jeweller and Lewis Grant - at around 1pm on Wednesday.But they escaped only with watches from Rox. Police say one, a Hublot Big Bang Rose Gold watch, is worth &pound;23,000.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
