New housing development will be inspired by the success of performers like Troon's own Paul Foster Troon streets to be named after Scots' gold medal heroes from Commonwealth Games - Daily Record Troon is to get the Midas touch - with every street in a massive new estate getting a touch of GOLD.
All streets in the vast Stewart Milne development at Barassie Farm will be named after the Scots who won gold this summer.
Our own bowls hero Paul Foster will get the first street - which could be Foster Green - named in his honour.
And the main drag through the 680-house extension to the town is to be called Commonwealth Drive.
It is thought this is the first development in Scotland to grab the Commonwealth theme after the success of the Glasgow Games.
Though officially there is to be a consultation period, South Ayrshire Councillor Phil Saxton revealed the plan last week.
Speaking at Troon Community Council, housing supremo Mr Saxton said the idea had been sparked after a failed attempt to get the unnamed street outside Portland Bowling Club, where Paul plays, named after him.
He said: “We are eager to recognise Paul with an accolade.
“We don’t own the street with no name outside the bowling club so that is out of the question.
“The north east development in Troon gives us the chance to honour Paul and every Scot who got a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games.”
And community council vice chairman Dougie Graham said: “I think it’s an excellent idea.”
And Erica Williamson added: “I think Commonwealth Drive is absolutely brilliant.”
Earthmovers are shifting land for the first 290 homes on the 106 acre spot.
Our new ‘Commonwealth village’ will be home to 2500 people, one sixth of the town’s population.
It will take eight years to complete, including 100 social houses, a watery bird and wild flower haven and two village greens.
There may be more than a dozen streets leading into small housing enclaves - and there are 20 Scottish gold medallists to consider.
