CALLOUS conmen are trying to dupe innocent people out of their cash with a sick new scam cashing in on debt worries. New scam bid to cash in on worry over debt CALLOUS conmen are trying to dupe innocent people out of their cash with a sick new scam cashing in on debt worries.Glasgow residents are being warned to be aware of cold callers who claim to be from the Citizens Advice Bureau.Over the last few weeks, the CAB has had reports of calls being made from Glasgow, Angus, Fife and Berwickshire trying to con people out of cash.A spokesman for the charity said the experiences reported are similar, suggesting a co-ordinated scam is underway.In each case, the call was completely unsolicited and the person had had no previous contact with the CAB.The callers claimed to be from the agency and asked if the householder needed advice on debt or money worries.They then asked for the person's bank details so they could help clear their debts and offer other financial services.CAB chief executive Margaret Lynch said: &quot;I want to state very clearly that the Scottish CAB service never makes unsolicited calls to anyone asking for their personal and bank details.&quot;And nor would any reputable organisation. If you get such a call, it is a scam.&quot;We do, of course, offer financial and debt advice.&quot;Indeed this is one of our main areas of work in the CAB service today - helping people to escape the misery of debt and manage their finances better.&quot;But we only give this help to people who have come to us and sought it. We do not cold-call &shy;anyone.&quot;It is very sad some people want to con their fellow citizens out of their money.&quot;It is particularly sad they would do so by using the hard-won reputation of the CAB service as an expert debt advice service.&quot;I want to make sure nobody loses a penny to these scams and that means spreading the word as widely as possible about it.&quot;Our concern is we don't know how many such calls are being made and how many people are in fact giving their details and so losing their money.&quot;Ms Lynch said anyone who receives an un-solicited call from the CAB should not give out any personal details.She added: &quot;Instead, challenge them to give you their full contact details, their website and the name of someone at the CAB service you can call to verify their identity.&quot;After they hang up, dial 1471 to see if you can get the number.&quot;Citizen's Advice Bureau Glasgow gives free, confidential, impartial and independent information and advice and works to help resolve issues.The independent, non-profit-making charity can be contacted at 0141 552 5556.vivienne.nicoll@eveningtimes.co.uk
