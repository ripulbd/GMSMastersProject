Drumchapel thug Kelly told to hand himself in A FORMER top cop today urged Britain's most wanted man to give himself up.Graeme Pearson MSP, the former head of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, appealed to fugitive Jonathan Kelly to &quot;see sense&quot; and hand himself in.As the 34-year-old continues to evade capture, the Labour MSP and justice spokesman backed police who are working to &quot;flush out&quot; Kelly.The knife thug, from Drumchapel, has been on the run for a month, since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.And tonight detectives are due to make an appeal for information on BBC's Crimewatch.Mr Pearson told the Evening Times: &quot;The police have all the intelligence at their disposal and I respect their assessment in this case.&quot;No doubt the officers in pursuit of this man will face a different level of threat.&quot;His comments come after repeated efforts by senior officers to reassure the public by claiming Kelly isn't a danger.Mr Pearson added: &quot;I hope Kelly sees sense and gives himself up.&quot;Police also admitted there have been no confirmed sightings of Kelly, who once paralysed a man with a machete.The Evening Times understands that, because of the risk he poses, armed cops will be drafted in as soon as Kelly is spotted.He has been branded &quot;too dangerous&quot; by some insiders, and armed officers will be brought in at the point of arrest.We previously revealed that Kelly was acquitted of nine charges at the High Court in Glasgow on August 21.He does, however, have a string of convictions for violence and has boasted about the machete attack.One insider said: &quot;He's too dangerous to be out on the streets.&quot;rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk
