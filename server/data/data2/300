MSP Jackie Bailliie hits out after Scottish Government reveal new hospital figures Cancer targets missed in Dumbarton, the Vale of Leven and Helensburgh - Daily Record New figures reveal crucial targets for cancer patients have been missed again in Dumbarton, the Vale and Helensburgh and Lomond.
Newly published Scottish Government figures show that NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde failed to meet targets designed to cut treatment waiting times for cancer patients.
In the three months until June this year, 91.6 percent of patients in NHS Highland and 90.7 percent in NHS Glasgow Greater Glasgow and Clyde received cancer treatment within the first two months of referral.
This is despite a Scottish Government-set target to start treatment in at least 95 percent of cases within 62 days.
Nine out of the 14 health boards in Scotland missed the target, including the two health boards which serve Dumbarton, Vale of Leven and Helensburgh and Lomond.
Dumbarton MSP Jackie said: “It is disappointing that once again these vital targets are not being met. Finding out you have cancer is hard enough so it is unacceptable that one in 10 people are having to wait over two months for treatment to start.
“These targets were supposed to guarantee cancer patients no more than a 62 day wait between referral and treatment. But the figures show that waiting times have actually increased compared to the same period last year and some people are forced to wait over six months for treatment in the worst cases. The SNP’s failure to take decisive action is letting down patients in Dumbarton, the Vale of Leven and Helensburgh and Lomond.”
