False alarm over fake snake call to Scottish SPCA An animal welfare officer who was dispatched to a call about a stray snake in Glasgow found the cause of alarm was a rubber toy.
A woman called the Scottish SPCA on 10 October after placing a cardboard box over what she thought was a 2ft snake in the city's Claremont Street.
When Senior Inspector Billy Linton arrived he was amused to find a static rubber reptile lurking under the box.
He said the toy was lifelike and he could understand why it caused alarm.
Mr Linton said: &quot;The woman had put a cardboard box over the snake to contain it and I lifted it with caution as I expected the snake to be moving. However, I soon realised it was made of rubber.
&quot;The toy is quite lifelike so I can understand why the woman was fooled. She genuinely thought it was real and was very frightened.
&quot;Many of the incidents I attend involve injured and neglected animals, so this was a bit of light hearted relief and it certainly put a smile on my face.&quot;
Mr Linton added: &quot;While this particular rescue turned out to be a false alarm, we'd still always encourage anyone with concerns for an animal to contact us.&quot;
