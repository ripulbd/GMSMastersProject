Perms, Manicures and Tints is set in a Glasgow hairdressers/beauticians, in a small, not very trendy, backstreet, and is based around a typical working day in the shop Blantyre Playwright brings Perms, Manicures and Tints to East Kilbride Arts Centre - Daily Record A Blantyre playwright is set to bring his sold out comedy play back to East Kilbride Arts Centre this October.
Graham Johnstone, who is originally from Blantyre, but now lives in Hillhouse, has been involved in Lanarkshire Little Theatre for a number of years.
Helping out backstage with the set he thought of an idea for a comedy play and sat down and wrote the comedy Perms, Manicures and Tints.
He said: “The comedy is set in a Glasgow hairdressers/beauticians, a small, not very trendy, backstreet establishment and is based around a typical working day in the shop and set around the workers and various customers coming and going.” This is the first play that Graham has written and directed.
He added: “It is the very first stage play I have written and first time ever directing but it was very enjoyable.
“The stage play itself ended up being a massive hit, with all nights being sold out and many people not getting to see it due to it being sold out, so much so that East Kilbride Arts Centre suggested to the Lanarkshire Little Theatre that we put the comedy back on in October this year, which we are doing.”
The show will now run on October 22, 23, 24 and 25 at the Art Centre.
On October 22, this will be a charity night for Help for Heroes and all proceeds being donated to the charity.
Tickets for the show cost &pound;9/&pound;7 concession and are available from the box office venue 01355 261000.
