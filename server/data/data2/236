Drumchapel thug now the most wanted man in Britain KNIFE thug Jonathan Kelly is the top target on a list of most-wanted criminals in the UK.The 34-year-old has been on the run in Glasgow for a month since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.Police have so far failed to find him.Today the Evening Times can reveal he has been named on Crime-stoppers' hit list of dangerous criminals on the run.Kelly, of Drumchapel, went into hiding weeks after he was acquitted of historic rape and abduction charges.A team of dedicated officers is working around the clock to &quot;flush him out&quot;.Kelly, locked up for crimes of violence, had been freed from Low Moss Prison, Bishop-briggs, but failed to report to police.One senior police source believes Kelly has been supported by friends - or former inmates from his long spell in prison.He said: &quot;We are trawling CCTV and the internet for information which will lead us to Kelly. We are also widening the net, not just speaking to the same four or five associates. We are looking at people he may have come into contact with in prison.&quot;It might take some time, but we will flush him out.&quot;Officers also believe Kelly's digital footprint - including any possible social media profiles - could be key to hunting him down.Last month, we told that he was acquitted of nine charges at the High Court in Glasgow on August 21.Not proven verdicts were returned on four charges - including sexual assault - and not guilty on the remaining five charges, including abduction. The three sexual assaults, one indecent assault and abduction, were alleged to have taken place between 1998 and 2002.People have been warned not to approach Kelly and to call 999 if they spot him.rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk
