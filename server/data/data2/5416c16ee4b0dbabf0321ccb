Cameron of the 3rd Kilmarnock Company of the Boys’ Brigade ( St Andrew’s and St Marnock’s Church ) was asked to deliver the Burns recital after grabbing the attention of Boys’ Brigade leaders at a local event earlier this year, where he delivered an outstanding recital of Tam O’Shanter from memory.
Cameron, 15, said: “Reciting Burns is a real passion and I’ve enjoyed performing it in public in my home town as well as at national events.
“Being a member of the BB is really important to me and it was a great honour to deliver the address at the annual Boys’ Brigade dinner.”
Cameron was one of a number of young members to play an active role in the one-day event. Local BB bands from Tulliallan, Dunblane and Glasgow welcomed over 210 leaders to Glasgow.
Bill Stevenson, Director of The Boys’ Brigade, Scotland, said: “What made the event special was the input from our young members including Cameron, who gave a superb recital of the ‘Address to the Haggis’.”
