ONE parent at the city centre school said the play area had changed little since World War I and so was desperately in need of a revamp. Parents at Glasgow's Garnetbank Primary School make plea for help in playground funding vote - Daily Record PUPILS at a city centre primary school are appealing for help to transform their playground into a fun zone.
Garnetbank Primary are urging Glaswegians to vote for them to win community funding from the Bank of Scotland to install play equipment.
The parent council say the revamp is desperately needed and one member claimed the playground has changed little since World War I.
Mum Chirsty Hamilton said it was important for children’s health and wellbeing to have a fun and safe place to play.
She said: “A lot of children in inner city Glasgow have no gardens or back courts. Most live in tenements and don’t have much&nbsp;access to green space in their communities.
“Every child should have access to natural, exciting and stimulating play areas - to be able to engage their imagination and to just be able to have fun with&nbsp;their friends.
“And having access to some form of outdoor sporting facilities would greatly benefit all the children and allow them to play healthily outside for longer.&nbsp;
“Sadly councils don’t seem to be investing in school playgrounds, but the parent council are now very dedicated to trying to raise the necessary funds.”
It is estimated the project will cost &pound;67,000 and parents have been fundraising for 18 months.
Glasgow City Council have pledged to pay for resurfacing.
Strathclyde University’s architects have done a study of the playground and pupils took part in a competition to design the area.
