Its aim is to highlight the preventable nature of most workplace accidents and to support campaigns promoting improvements in workplace safety.The memorial, which has a black and purple theme to reflect the colours associated with International Workers' Memorial Day, was chosen from ideas put forward by Glasgow secondary pupils.Deputy Lord Provost Gerry Leonard said: &quot;This is an opportunity to highlight and support the campaigns working to achieve safer workplaces and to remember those killed, disabled or injured.&quot;This should be a memorial where families can come not just on International Workers' Memorial Day but at significant anniversaries to remember those who can't be there to share these memories.&quot;The consequences of workplace tragedies cause massive grief and personal heartache to the families who lose loved ones and life-changing consequences for those who were injured.&quot;Grahame Smith, STUC general secretary, said trade union health and safety representatives make a massive difference in workplaces around the world.He added: &quot;Some employers continue to ignore their responsibilities and unfortunately their workers pay the cost of that negligence - sometimes with their lives and very often with serious physical or psychological damage.&quot;Thanks to Glasgow City Council we have a memorial to be proud of and a fitting focus for annual commemorations to remember those who lost their lives as a result of work and commit to continuing to campaign for improved health and safety in our workplaces.&quot;Along with the council we would welcome further donations as we look to develop an exhibition so we can take a positive health and safety message into Glasgow's schools.&quot;It is important we reach young people as many of them are inexperienced once they enter the workplace and are still training.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
