The raiders escaped down a lane off Buchanan Street. It is thought they used a white Volkswagen Golf, which was later recovered in Townhead.
In the mobile phone footage, the men can be seen running through the arcade and attempting to smash shop windows.
The centre also filled with smoke as an alarm on one shop was triggered.
The men entered the arcade from Argyle Street and exited on Buchanan Street, where footage shows them running down a lane.
It is understood that a security guard was knocked over during the robbery and injured his leg.
Police said the four suspects are described as 5ft 8in tall and of slim build. All were wearing dark clothing. 
It is believed that they made off in a white hatchback vehicle. 
A white Volkswagen Golf was recovered in St James Road, in the city's Townhead area, and inquiries are ongoing to establish if it is the vehicle involved.
Officers are speaking to witnesses and gathering CCTV images to establish more details on the four men responsible.
