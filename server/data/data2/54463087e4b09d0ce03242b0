 The former Ibrox director has submitted a funding offer, which is dependent on a new share issue being approved at the club's annual general meeting. 
 With 75% shareholder support required, King needs backing from at least part of a group for whom Sandy Easdale currently holds voting rights.  
 However, indications are that the group, who collectively own more than 26%, is unlikely to be fragmented. 
 Asked about that, King replied: &quot;It is essential they are on board&quot;, adding that &quot;we will know soon enough&quot; if there is a prospect of that happening. 
 South Africa-based King met some of the board last Tuesday to detail his proposal, some of which would be a loan, with the majority to go in as part of a new share issue. 
 He has been speaking to some of the Championship club's bigger shareholders but expects the board to do likewise and assure him he will get that 75% before he commits any money. 
 Laxey Partners are Rangers' biggest shareholder with 16%, while Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who owns 9%, is trying to remove the chief executive Graham Wallace and the finance director Philip Nash. 
 Rangers are required to hold an AGM before the end of the year.
