Holyrood powers issue 'is one for all' ALEX Salmond challenged his opponents in the Scottish Parliament to ensure more powers came to Holyrood.The First Minister, speaking in the parliament for the first time since the referendum result, said the people would not tolerate any delay and said Labour, the Tories and LibDems had responsibilty for delivery.Party leaders made speeches praising the electorate and both camp-aigns while condemning the few who marred the poll with intimidation, abuse and violence.Following a time-for- reflection speech by Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick, calling for MSPs to face the challenges of the future together, it was business as usual with point scoring and jibes.Ms Salmond had said Scotland was a better nation and people had been energised by the debate.He then turned his attention to the new powers debate and the role of his opponents.He said: &quot;Scotland now has a responsibility to hold Westminster's feet to the fire to ensure the pledges are met.&quot;That's not just a job for the Scottish Government, it is one for all parties in the Parliament.

We need to move on.&quot;Her speech was met with some applause from her own benches and from the Conservatives opposite.SNP members shook their heads and many began talking to colleagues as she spoke. By the time Ruth Davidson spoke for the Conservatives, some Labour and SNP MSPs decided it was time to leave or fetch water.Her speech mentioned the need for the SNP to accept the result and accused the party of sniping from the sidelines.Her speech failed to get any reciprocal applause from Labour benches and interruptions for the SNP were met with the Presiding offer calling for &quot;wheesht!&quot;.stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
