THE new owner of a shipyard that went into administration with the loss of 70 jobs is rehiring workers made redundant. McColl's first task is rehiring workers THE new owner of a shipyard that went into administration with the loss of 70 jobs is rehiring workers made redundant.Ferguson Shipbuilders, in Port Glasgow, went into administration last month after experiencing &quot;significant cash-flow pressure&quot;.It has been acquired by Clyde Blowers Capital, which was founded by businessman Jim McColl.Mr McColl said 30 of the 70 people made redundant last month had returned and that the number of staff would rise to 80 by November.The company will be renamed Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd and will service the oil and gas, marine and renewables sectors.Mr McColl aims to invest &pound;8 million and employ up to 300 people in the long-term.By early next year he aims to have a workforce of 100 people.The Clyde Blowers owner said he would change the direction of the shipyard to focus on fabrication in the oil and gas and renewable energy sectors. As well as ships, the new firm will build components for the oil and gas industry and machinery to be used in Scotland's offshore renewables sector.Mr McColl said he was keen to retain the brand and the existing workforce.He said: &quot;I think there's a great opportunity to rebuild the business here. We expect there to be a healthy demand for ships.&quot;A lot of the ships that would be suitable to build in this yard are old and there's a great opportunity for new business to come in here.&quot;There's going to be a lot of demand and there are few shipyards left. I think there are only two with the capabilities of Ferguson.&quot;And then there is the workforce here and the skills that are here. There is a good opportunity for us to do a broader range of work with the skillset we have.&quot;Blair Nimmo, joint administrator and head of restructuring at KPMG in Scotland, said: &quot;It is extremely pleasing to secure the sale of Ferguson Shipbuilders in such a short timeframe and to buyers who can see the potential in the business and its skilled workforce.&quot;We would like to thank those employees, and all parties with an interest in Ferguson Shipbuilders, including various government agencies, for their patience and support during this period.&quot;We would also like to wish Clyde Blowers Capital every success for the future. As new owners they have an ambitious vision to build on its heritage and grow a successful shipbuilding and marine engineering business on the Clyde.&quot;Mr McColl previously told the Evening Times: &quot;The idea of shipbuilding dying here is nuts. We can be global leaders as we were in the past.&quot;victoria.brenan@ eveningtimes.co.uk
