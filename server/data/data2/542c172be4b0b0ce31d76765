T in the Park bosses have begun the application process to host next year's event at Strathallan Castle. Documents lodged for T in the Park to be held in Strathallan Castle in 2015 T in the Park bosses have begun the application process to host next year's event at Strathallan Castle.DF Concerts, which runs Scotland's biggest music festival, has lodged &quot;pre-application plan&quot; documents with Perth and Kinross Council.The papers contain an outline of the work needed to bring the festival into being on the new Perthshire site and of the official consultations organisers will have with the local community.A full planning application is expected to be submitted to the council around the end of the year.The festival, which celebrated its 21st birthday this year, has been held at the disused Balado airfield in Kinross-shire for much of the last two decades.However, it is set to be transported to the grounds of the 19th-century castle following health and safety concerns about an underground oil pipeline at the Balado site.The documents lodged with the council state that organisers will apply for permission to allow &quot;engineering and other operations to facilitate the establishment and use of a venue for the purposes of holding a music event&quot;.The papers further set out that bosses will ask for the use of the land and existing buildings in July each year for the purposes of holding the festival and linked activities.These are listed as &quot;a funfair, cinema, sale and consumption of hot and cold food and drink and alcohol, vehicle parking and temporary accommodation, including camping&quot;.A map of the Strathallan Castle grounds is also contained in the document, outlining the possible area required for the event.Under the plans, two community exhibitions will be held next month as part of moves to consult the community.One will take place at Aytoun Hall, Auchterarder, on November 20 between 4pm and 8pm while the other will be the following day at the Strathearn Community Campus in Crieff between 10am and 2pm.Organisers stress that they have already been talking to local residents on a one-to-one basis over a number of months about the festival plans.
