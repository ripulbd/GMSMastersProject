TEACHING all secondary pupils to perform CPR could save up to 100 lives a week, according to heart charity leaders. CPR classes in schools could help save lives TEACHING all secondary pupils to perform CPR could save up to 100 lives a week, according to heart charity leaders.A major campaign will be launched today in Glasgow by the British Heart Foundation to create a Nation of Lifesavers.Key to this, according to the charity, would be for life-saving skills to form part of the school curriculum.Research by the charity found that 85% of Scots believe teenagers should leave school with CPR training.In Norway, pupils are taught how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which has helped improve survival rates by up to 40%.Around 22,000 people die following heart attacks at home each year across the UK. Statistics show that 80% of the 30,000 annual out of hospital incidents occur in the home, often in front of family members and loved ones.But less than one in ten people survive - partly because people don't have the skills to perform CPR.In some cases, performing CPR will double a person's chance of survival.Research by BHF Scotland found that three quarters of the public would not feel confident performing CPR on a family member or loved one.Almost half (47%) would be deterred by the 'fear of causing more harm than good.'The BHF's new strategy includes a continued call to ensure all young people learn CPR in school and the roll-out of a new, quick-and-simple CPR training programme - Call. Push. Rescue.Marjory Burns, Director of BHF Scotland, said: &quot;Too many lives are lost need- lessly because people don't have the basic CPR skills.&quot;We need every school, workplace, community group and individual to be inspired to register for a free CPR training kit and help make Scotland a safer place to live.&quot;To help the BHF create a Nation of Lifesavers visit bhf.org.uk/lifesaverscaroline.wilson@eveningtimes.co.uk
