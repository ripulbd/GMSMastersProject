Neil MacMartin, developer of the SALTIRE e-bicycle, is aiming to raise £390,000 to take his patented technology into commercial development Scots entrepreneur aims to revolutionise electric bicycle technology Scots entrepreneur aims to revolutionise electric bicycle technology - Daily Record A Scottish entrepreneur has raised &pound;235,000 on a crowdfunding platform to further develop what he claims is the world's lightest electric bicycle.
Neil MacMartin, who launched his company FreeFlow Technologies in 2012, has developed the SALTIRE e-bicycle, reputed to be the lightest power to weight electric bike ever made.
FreeFlow Technologies has invented a gearing system and motor controller, which is reported to be 40 per cent more efficient than its closest rival.
The Glasgow-based company has so far raised &pound;235,000 through the Angels Den crowdfunding platform, and is aiming to raise &pound;390,000 in total to further develop the gearing systems and motor controller with a view to commercialising the technology.
MacMartin, whose dad has run a bike shop in Glasgow for the past 39 years, began developing the technology in response to a challenge from his dad to design and produce an electric bike which both looked and rode like a normal push bike.
“People stated to me that what I was trying to do is impossible and can’t be done,” MacMartin said.
“However, once they try what I have made and see how it works, they are usually left amazed.
“Most potential investors and customers do not need to know the complexities of how I have designed the bike, they just need to know that it rides like a normal bike when not powered, looks like a normal bike, is simple to get spare parts for and is easy to repair.
“The Saltire City is simply the most sophisticated e-bike built to date anywhere in the world.”
