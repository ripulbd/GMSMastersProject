Nelson Mandela bust takes pride of place in City Chambers This is the stunning new bust of Nelson Mandela which now takes pride of place in the City Chambers.Sculptor Deirdre Nicholls joined Lord Provost Sadie Docherty as she unveiled the &pound;20,000 work of art.Also present were South African High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Obed Mlaba and Brian Filling, Honorary Consul to South Africa.The ceremony took place to coincide with Mr Mandela's historic visit to Glasgow to accept the Freedom of the City.The city was the first in the world to award the honour to the political prisoner who spent 27 years behind bars because of his anti apartheid stance.He finally made his long walk to freedom in 1990 as apartheid laws were eased and the ban was lifted on leading black rights party the African National Congress.Mrs Docherty said: &quot;Nelson Mandela and this city's history are forever intertwined in the struggle to end apartheid.&quot;I am proud my predecessors had the courage of their convictions - Lord Provost Michael Kelly who made the award in 1981 and Lord Provost Bob Innes who met the great man when he visited Glasgow 12 years later in 1993.&quot;I know Mr Mandela felt that Glasgow's granting him the Freedom of the City brought global attention to his imprisonment and his cause. He firmly believed our city's bold move helped secure his release.&quot;This stunning sculpture will serve as a lasting legacy of the enduring bonds forged between the former South African President, Glasgow and the South African anti-apartheid movement.&quot;Sculptor Deirdre Nicholls was responsible for the 66lb bronze work.She said: &quot;I have tried to capture many moods - his statesman-like demeanour, his humour, solemnity and gentleness.&quot;It has been a great honour and responsibility to recreate a global icon and I hope people enjoy it.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@eveningtimes.co.uk
