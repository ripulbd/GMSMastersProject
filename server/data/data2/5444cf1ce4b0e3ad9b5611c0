A GLASGOW nightclub wants to stay open an extra hour after revellers admitted going to rival city centre venues because they can drink and dance until later. Nightclub thinks its time to be given an extra hour A GLASGOW nightclub wants to stay open an extra hour after revellers admitted going to rival city centre venues because they can drink and dance until later.The Shed, in Shawlands, is being backed by local traders in its bid to persuade licensing bosses to allow the club to extend opening hours from 2am to 3am.Venue bosses conducted a survey among customers who admitted they would remain at The Shed if it opened later rather than go to rival clubs in the city centre, which are licensed until 3am.Denise Irvine, a regular at the club, said: &quot;It would be great if The Shed stayed open until 3am. I would definitely go more often. Staying local is not only a good night out, it is cheaper and hassle free.&quot;Local eateries and pubs also want the Shawlands club to stay open longer.Jayz Bar owner Gary Broadhurst said: &quot;On the rare occasion The Shed is granted a special 3am licence we have noticed a sharp increase in the volume of people visiting the bar.&quot;I can't speak on behalf of other bars in the area, but I am fairly confident they also see an increase during this time. I hope Glasgow City Council takes into consideration the benefits of a 3am licence to our city and its economy.&quot;The application for an extension is being heard this Friday by the city council's licensing board. The Shed owner Michele Pagliocca is hoping it will be a cause of celebration.He said: &quot;Over the years the volume of people visiting our club has dwindled as potential customers increasingly choose to visit bars and clubs in the city centre or venues in the West End that have 3am licences.&quot;This extra hour offered by our competitors has had a direct impact on our business. It is no longer commercially viable to open our doors four nights a week, instead we can open only on Fridays and Saturdays.&quot;If our licence was extended it would encourage more people to stay in the area, which I expect would have a positive impact on the local economy and generate a more vibrant Shawlands.&quot;Mr Pagliocca is also being backed by the Tram Direct Theatre Company and Shawlands Business Association, while a letter of support from local councillor Archie Graham is to be lodged with licensing board members.gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
