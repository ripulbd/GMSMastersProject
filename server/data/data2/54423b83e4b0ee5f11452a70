Alex Neil delighted at latest Hamilton Academical win  Alex Neil praised Hamilton Academical's latest win as the New Douglas Park side secured top spot in the Premiership for at least another week. 
 Player-manager Neil watched on from the technical area as Accies beat Aberdeen 3-0 in Lanarkshire. 
 And the win took Hamilton four points clear of second-place Dundee United, who face Partick Thistle on Saturday. 
 &quot;The group in general were just fantastic and obviously Tony Andreu gets his two goals as well,&quot; said Neil. 
 Mickael Antoine-Curier netted the third Accies goal and the striker's lone forward performance was especially pleasing to Neil. 
 Neil also highlighted the contributions of midfielder Danny Redmond and goalkeeper Michael McGovern as Hamilton stretched their unbeaten run in all competitions to 11 games. 
 &quot;We're just playing as well as we can,&quot; explained Neil. &quot;We're doing well, we've got good players and we work our socks off. 
 &quot;Sometimes you need a wee bit of the rub of the green as well. Michael kept us in it a few times. 
 &quot;The work ethic of the group and the quality that I've got in the squad, I've been saying it for a long time. I think people are starting to believe me now. 
 &quot;There's still things to work on but when we beat Aberdeen 3-0, you can't really complain. 
 &quot;It will always be more difficult [as the season goes on] but I'm sure Aberdeen would've thought before they played us that, 'we've seen what they're capable of doing, we know exactly what they can do' and we managed to win the game.&quot;
