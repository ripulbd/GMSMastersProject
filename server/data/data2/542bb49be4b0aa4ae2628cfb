THE stairs, a popular lunchtime haunt for Glaswegians and buskers, are to be removed to allow the expansion of the Buchanan Galleries shops, prompting anger from locals. Independence referendum campaigns show Buchanan Street's Royal Concert Hall steps should be saved, say politicians - Daily Record THE Buchanan Street steps should be saved after they were used by both sides in the referendum campaign, politicians have said.
The steps leading to the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall are to be removed as part of the Buchanan Galleries redevelopment and be replaced by an atrium.
During the lead up to the vote last week, the Yes and No campaigns rallied supporters and were challenged by opponents in the spirited fight over the future of Scotland.
Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: “During the final weeks of the referendum, the Royal Concert Hall steps were used by both sides of the referendum campaign as a place to gather and speak to members of the public.
“It will be a real shame if the steps go and Glasgow loses what is clearly a much-loved public space.
“A city centre is not just for shopping – people need somewhere they can gather, even if that’s just to eat their lunch on a rare sunny day.
“I hope that the recent positive use of the steps demonstrates to Glasgow City Council the need to take the role of civic space in our city more seriously in future planning decisions.”
 

SNP councillor Billy McAllister added: “I think it helped as a gathering place. It would be a great loss to remove them.”
But council bosses said the plans for the site would benefit the public.
A council spokesman said: “The redevelopment of Buchanan Galleries will involve removing the steps as a part of the new design which will feature an atrium as the entrance to the expanded Galleries.
“Among the benefits to the public will be greater accessibility. There is no shortage of meeting or rallying points in Glasgow and the city centre.”
