Actor Paul Brannigan launches competition aimed at fighting violence A FILM competition for young people to highlight the evils of knife crime and online bullying has been launched in Glasgow.The We-CTV competition, run by the Scottish Youth Parliament and now in its fifth year, aims to educate young people on the consequences of violence.This year's contest was launched by Paul Brannigan at Glasgow Film Theatre yesterday.It is open to young people across Scotland, aged eight to 18, to create film, artwork or literature highlighting violence involving knife crime, abuse or online bullying.Glasgow-born Paul, best known for his River City role as Gareth O'Connor, said: &quot;By giving young people a voice, allowing them to be creative and help get the message across in a way that their age group understands, We-CTV is a powerful tool.&quot;Not only does the compe-tition get young people to think about the conse-quences of violence, it helps them develop skills such as acting, production, creative writing and artwork, which can help them in later life.&quot;We-CTV is an ideal way to reach out to young people and their peer groups to highlight that interpersonal violence is unacceptable. I look forward to seeing this year's entries.&quot;The Scottish Youth Parliament will host a National Production Day to show young people how to develop their creative ideas. Experts in video production, writing and art as well as knife crime and violence reduction, will be on hand.David Stewart, member of the Scottish Youth Parliament and We-CTV Champion, said it was a &quot;fantastic opportunity&quot; for young people to make a difference in their local community. He added: &quot;Young people believe the solutions to solving the problem of knife crime lie in working with young people to tackle the root causes.&quot;Visit www.syp.org.ukvictoria.brenan@ eveningtimes.co.uk
