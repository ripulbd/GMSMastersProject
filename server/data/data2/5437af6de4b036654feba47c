Inverclyde Council has reversed a decision to leave Cosla - the body representing Scottish local government. Inverclyde Council reverses decision to leave Cosla Inverclyde Council has reversed a decision to leave Cosla - the body representing Scottish local government.
The authority said in February it would give the umbrella body one year notice and terminate its membership in 2015.
Councillors reversed their stance after hearing Cosla had issued a revised constitution which highlights that there is no hierarchy between members.
Several others councils remain set to quit amid a row over government cash and tensions about power within Cosla.
Aberdeen, Glasgow, Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire Councils have all indicated they plan to leave Cosla next year.
Inverclyde's council leader, Councillor Stephen McCabe, said: &quot;We raised our concerns earlier this year and Cosla has responded to those. 
&quot;Our notice to quit was a requirement of our membership but we made clear at the time that the door was open for the council to return. 
&quot;We have decided to do that and the council will confirm that we will remain a member of the organisation.&quot;
Inverclyde's annual membership fees to Cosla are &pound;60,000.
