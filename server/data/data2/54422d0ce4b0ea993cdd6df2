THE UK Government is not only meeting, but beating, its timetable for further devolution, the Scottish Secretary said, as he warned nationalists that calls for a second independence referendum would "risk dividing Scotland". Carmichael tells SNP, don't divide Scotland THE UK Government is not only meeting, but beating, its timetable for further devolution, the Scottish Secretary said, as he warned nationalists that calls for a second independence referendum would "risk dividing Scotland".Alistair Carmichael spoke out exactly one month on from the referendum ballot, which saw Scots reject independence by a majority of 55% to 45%.Since then senior figures in the SNP, including First Minister Alex Salmond, have raised the prospect of having another vote on Scotland's place in the UK.Mr Carmichael urged Mr Salmond's successor, Nicola Sturgeon - who will take over unopposed as SNP leader and First Minister next month - to &quot;show genuine leadership and accept the result&quot;.The UK Government minister said: &quot;The referendum gave us a decisive result.&quot;We are now working to build a stronger Scottish Parliament. Calling for a second referendum and reflecting on what could have been is entirely inappropriate.&quot;The Smith Commission has been set up to consider what further powers could be transferred to Holyrood. Political leaders have already made their submissions to this body, which will produce its recommendations by the end of November.But a spokeswoman for Ms Sturgeon hit back, saying: &quot;One month on from the referendum, this is desperate stuff from the Secretary of State when it is the UK parties and the Westminster parliament who are busy squabbling over more powers for Scotland and falling out with each other over English votes for English laws.&quot;The SNP is playing a full part in the Smith Commission and we look forward to beginning negotiations next week.&quot;As Lord Smith pointed out only yesterday, 'the SNP have absolutely committed to be part of this process and to take it very seriously and in a spirit of compromise'.&quot;She continued: &quot;In the month since the referendum we have produced our submission to the Smith Commission, continued our engagement with the people of Scotland on more powers and witnessed a phenomenal rise in SNP membership as more and more people realise that it is the SNP that delivers for Scotland.&quot;
