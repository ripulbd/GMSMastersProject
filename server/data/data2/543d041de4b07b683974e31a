A six-strong syndicate from Glasgow has scooped more than £300,000 on the Lottery Euromillions draw. Lottery joy for Glasgow construction syndicate after buying winning tickey in Clydebank A six-strong syndicate from Glasgow has scooped more than £300,000 on the Lottery Euromillions draw.And it was beginners' luck for the six construction workers as they had never played the Lottery together before.Their total prize is &pound;333,167.40 after they matched five numbers and one Lucky Star in last Tuesday, October 7 draw.Syndicate members Nigel Himsworth 41, Adam Wright 27, Ashley Robinson 28, Adam Booth 20, Michael Hunt 31 and Darren Fisher 42, who all work in Glasgow but live near each other in South Yorkshire, will each take a &pound;55,527.90 share of the win. The men work for specialist contractor Kirk Environmental and have been in the city for the past few weeks.Nigel said: “I buy a ticket for EuroMillions when it’s a rollover and had bought mine one morning before work. A couple of the lads are new to the team and we were chatting and decided we would give it a go as a syndicate.“We each put on three Lucky Dips and on the Wednesday morning we checked our tickets. Four of us had checked our tickets on the way to work and when we arrived Ashley checked what turned out to be the winning ticket. We heard him shouting a mile away!&quot;The syndicate members then had a nervous wait before they could confirm their win.Nigel added: “We had checked the tickets at 7am and the claim line didn’t open until 9am so we were all pacing up and down until we knew everything was confirmed.“We’re over the moon with our win. We went out for a celebration at the weekend when we were home and we were treated like pop stars. It hasn’t really sunk in yet so no one has decided what to spend their money on at this stage but I’m sure there will be a few holidays being planned.”And there shouldn’t be any problems with the team getting time off as Adam Wright is the foreman. He and Nigel have known each other for 12 years and worked together for six; Ashley has also worked alongside the men for several years while the other members of the syndicate are newer to the team.The winning ticket was bought from The Post Office and Newsagents in Dumbarton Road, Clydebank.
