FAMILIES affected by a C.diff outbreak that led to the deaths of 28 patients will finally get some answers next month. Superbug hospital report due FAMILIES affected by a C.diff outbreak that led to the deaths of 28 patients will finally get some answers next month.The findings of a delayed &pound;10million inquiry into the outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital will be revealed next month, more than five years after it was commissioned.Lord MacLean, chairman of the inquiry, has written to Health Secretary Alex Neil to advise that his report will be published on November 24 and Mr Neil has informed the Scottish Parliament.The inquiry was set up in 2009 to investigate the treatment of 63 patients at the hospital in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, between December 1, 2007, and June 1, 2008. Of the 31 patients who died during this period, C.diff has been identified as a contributory factor in 28 of the deaths.The report had originally been due to be made public by the end of May, 2011, but has been repeatedly delayed due to factors including a period of illness suffered by the chairman.A fifth delay announced in February pushed back a publication date of March, 2014, because the inquiry was still waiting for responses to warning letters issued to those likely to be the subject of criticism.Last week Jackie Baillie MSP raised a motion calling on Health Secretary Alex Neil to ensure the findings of the report were published &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.She said: &quot;Significant delays in reporting have caused untold damage to the families who lost loved ones almost seven years ago. Five years after it was announced families are going through the pain of their loved ones' deaths, without answers.&quot;Her plea was backed by the campaign group, C.Diff Families Justice Group, which was set up by Michelle McGinty, whose mother-in-law died in the superbug outbreak.The inquiry has looked at other outbreaks of C.diff infection to make its recommendations. It does not have any power to determine civil or criminal liability in relation to the outbreak.caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
