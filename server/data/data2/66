A NEW scheme has been launched to cut the number of cyclists hurt in road accidents. Cycle Aware scheme will put riders in the picture A NEW scheme has been launched to cut the number of cyclists hurt in road accidents.To highlight the campaign, a group of bike fans took their vintage cycles for a spin in George Square.The Cycle Aware scheme, which has been developed by Go Safe Glasgow, focuses on improving road users' perception of hazards.Accessed online, it contains more than 200 narrated film clips, accompanied by 100 multiple choice questions aimed at five different types of road users.People taking the course can choose the role of cyclist, car, taxi, bus or lorry driver.This allows them to take part in a 30-minute interactive course filmed from the perspective of their chosen road user. Manoeuvres unique to each form of transport are included.Frank McAveety, convener of the city council's sustainability and the environment committee, said: &quot;Cycling is one of the most popular participation sports in Glasgow and is firmly established as a major form of commuting.&quot;It's important cyclists and other road users have a clear understanding of their responsibilities on the road and how they respond to the actions of others&quot;The real strength of the Cycle Aware resource lies in the ability to participate and interact in the role of one of the five road users.&quot;It is hoped by highlighting and demonstrating how accidents occur, we can promote a safer shared road space.&quot;Glasgow is progressing well in cutting the number of road casualties.&quot;This couldn't have been achieved without the support and the hard work of staff and partners involved in the promotion and delivery of road safety education.&quot;The Go Safe Glasgow partnership will be promoting the course to cycling organisations, local businesses and the public.&quot;The council's road safety team has a proactive programme in place to visit every business across the city as part of both Cycle Aware and the Drive Safe Its Your Business initiative. &quot;The Cycle Aware road safety training videos can be accessed at www.gosafeglasgow.comGo Safe Glasgow is a partnership of the council, Police Scotland, Strathclyde Safety Camera Partnership, the Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue Service, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Community Safety Glasgow.vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
