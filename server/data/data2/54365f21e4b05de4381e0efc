The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) said footfall in August was 1.8% higher than the same period last year.
The figure was in sharp contrast with the UK as a whole, which saw shopper numbers fall by 1.1%.
The latest SRC/Springboard monitor found that out-of-town locations north of the border were the biggest draw, with a 4.1% rise in footfall. 
Numbers were also up on the high streets and in shopping centres.
Northern Ireland was the only area to record a larger percentage increase than Scotland, with a rise of 4.2%. 
Most of the rest of the UK saw footfall figures slip. 
Retail experts described the latest Scottish data as &quot;extremely positive&quot;.
SRC director David Lonsdale said: &quot;This is a further favourable set of results. 
&quot;For the second month in a row the number of shoppers visiting Scotland's high streets and shopping centres is above the level witnessed during the same period last year. 
&quot;Footfall has risen for four of the last five months, though this doesn't always necessarily translate into increased levels of actual sales.&quot;
