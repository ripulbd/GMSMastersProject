 Lewis Macleod marked his Rangers return with a magnificent overhead kick winner as the Ibrox side edged out Livingston. 
 The midfielder missed the last two weeks due to injury but took only eight minutes to make an impact, providing an acrobatic finish at the back post from Ian Black's lofted pass. 
 Rangers had chances to add to their tally but had to settle for one goal. 
 The result got the Ibrox men back to winning ways following their 3-1 defeat by Hibernian on Tuesday night. 
 That performance had left the Rangers faithful furious and their mood would have worsened if Livi's Danny Mullen had scored instead of firing over the bar after breaking through the visiting defence early on. 
 Macleod, however, eased any nerves in Ally McCoist's side with his sublime goal, showing no ill-effects from his recent ankle problems to beat goalkeeper Darren Jamieson. 
 Livi were forced into an early change after Craig Sives appeared to be knocked out cold when Nicky Law smashed a powerful shot straight into the defender's face from point-blank range, with Gary Glen on as his replacement. 
 Rangers went in 1-0 up at the break but a flashpoint among their fans in the stands during the opening 45 minutes would have been an unwelcome sight for club officials. 
 On the park, the visitors should have doubled their advantage early in the second period, but Kris Boyd's miserable luck in front of goal continued. 
 The former Scotland striker has yet to net in the league this season but thought his wait was over when Nicky Clark and Richard Foster combined to lay it on a plate for him six yards out. 
 Boyd's mortifying fresh-air swipe, however, summed up his afternoon and it was no surprise when he was hooked for Jon Daly soon after. 
 Clark had a bad miss of his own as he fired over from Lee Wallace's deep cross to the back post. 
 A stunning save by Jamieson was required to keep out McCulloch's volley from 10 yards with Rangers in full command by this point. 
 However, they were almost pegged back when Callum Fordyce crashed a 30-yard volley into the side-netting after an hour, while Jordan White screwed one wide soon after. 
 There was another scare when Black had to clear off his own goal-line after White looped a header over goalkeeper Steve Simonsen. 
 But Clark and Daly missed further chances to add gloss to the scoreline in the final 10 minutes as Rangers crawled over the line.
