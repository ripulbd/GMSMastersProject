BUSINESSES in Govan are to be charged £700 a year for parking spaces when a new hospital opens next year. Traders facing £700 bill to park near new hospital BUSINESSES in Govan are to be charged £700 a year for parking spaces when a new hospital opens next year.The Evening Times earlier revealed that residents will have to pay out &pound;50 annually when a new West End-style controlled parking scheme is set up.Now a council document distributed to houses in Govan has shown that business permits will cost much more.The letter signed by Andy Waddell, head of roads services, says: &quot;Business parking permits would be available at a cost of &pound;700 per year (less than &pound;3 per day), as per areas in the West End and would be unavailable to hospital staff.&quot;The letter also reveals that motorists will be charged 20p for the first thirty minutes and 30p for every ten minutes after that, up to a time limit of three hours.The new &pound;842million South Glasgow Hospital campus will employ more than 10,000 staff but fewer than 3000 parking spaces will be available on site.Ralph Pacitti opened his chip shop in nearby Shieldhall Road 28 years ago and he admits it has never been more difficult to turn a profit.He said: &quot;Business is bad enough without the council charging our staff and customers to park outside.&quot;I thought this new hospital would do us some good but now I have my reservations. I just think it's disgusting to charge businesses &pound;700 a year for a parking space. It's actually quite shocking.&quot;One worker at a nearby business, who asked not to be named, added: &quot;I can't afford to pay it. I've got young children to take to school too so I won't be able to get a bus. I don't know what I'll do when this starts.&quot;Lesley Byars, a service advisor at Glasgow Isuzu in Govan's Hardgate Road, said: &quot;The whole thing is ridiculous.&quot;We don't have enough spaces as it is. There are 30 people working here and at least a third park on the street.&quot;They're coming from all over the west of Scotland and can't be expected to take public transport when they often work irregular hours.&quot;I live in Paisley and I'd have to take two buses and leave at 5.30am to get here to start my shift at 7am.&quot;We will just need to create more space in the yard for staff parking, but that will be a big issue when we're busy.&quot;A senior source at insurance firm MORE TH&gt;N, which also has a site in Hardgate Road employing 50 staff, said: &quot;I find it absolutely incredible.&quot;It's nothing but a revenue raising exercise.&quot;We've been parking our cars for free for 15 years.&quot;We can't be expected to start paying &pound;700 a year.&quot;It will make it almost impossible for us to run our business here.&quot;A council spokesman said: &quot;The proposed parking controls aim to prevent streets in the area being used by drivers leaving their cars in the area - essentially using it as a free car park.&quot;We aim to protect both residential and short-stay business use parking as the current model could lead to businesses being hurt with customers unable to find parking spaces.&quot;Introducing parking controls would mean a turnover in the parking spaces allowing increased access for shoppers.&quot;n Exhibitions will be held at Elder Park library on October 23 and 24 between 10am and 5pm and on October 25 between 10am and 3pm when people can give their views.peter.swindon@eveningtimes.co.uk
