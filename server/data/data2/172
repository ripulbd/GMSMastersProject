Athletes lead the charge for Super Saturday run A record breaking runner and stars of the Commonwealth and Olympic Games led the charge for thousands of children and families on the opening day of the Great Scottish Run.Over 3,000 people took part in Super Saturday, in which young runners take part in Scotland's biggest mass participation event.The 2.5k Junior Run for children aged 9-15 was started by record breaking Ethiopian long-distance runner Haile Gebrselassie, and Commonwealth Games gold and bronze medal-winning swimmer Ross Murdoch.The event included young club runners from around Scotland with Lily Evans-Haggerty winning junior girls (9-11), Ethan McGlen clinching the junior boys (9-11) top spot, Laura Stark coming in first in the junior girls (12-15) and Jamie MacKinnon winning the junior boys (12-15).The wheelchair junior event was won by Kyle Brotherton, who also took the same top place in last month's Great North Run.Commonwealth Games marathon winner Michael Shelley sent off the family mile along with Mr Murdoch, while London 2012 Olympic marathon winner Tiki Gelana and two-time World Champion Marathon runner Edna Kiplagat started the Toddler Dash.Andy Mitchelmore from Nova International, organisers of the Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run, said: &quot;Super Saturday gives younger runners the chance to be part of Scotland's biggest running event. To have over 3,000 run with us today is fantastic.&quot;The square was absolutely buzzing and I'm sure seeing elite athletes like Haile Gebrselassie, Michael Shelley, Tiki Gelana and Edna Kiplagat will have inspired the children to continue running and hopefully follow on to the 10k and Half Marathon events in years to come. Who knows, maybe we have seen a mini Haile in the making.&quot;Robin Bulloch, managing director, Bank of Scotland Community Bank, said: &quot;Numbers of participants in today's junior and family events have again exceeded expectations and it has been a fantastic sight in George Square. We are proud to be involved in this, our fifth Great Scottish Run weekend, and today's races have once again proven this is an event for all ages and abilities.&quot;Tomorrow's Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run event will feature the 10k and Half Marathon where almost 25,000 are expected to take part across both distances in another sell-out year for the event. The event will be broadcast live on BBC 2 from 10.30am.
