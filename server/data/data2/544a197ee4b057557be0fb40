The firm will offer accounting, insurance, legal and HR services to start-ups and small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) from a new centre.
Geniac will collaborate with UK outsourcing business Webhelp UK and legal firm Harper Macleod.
The start-up said its centre would involve highly-skilled professional services jobs.
Geniac was founded by entrepreneurs and business consultants Eduardo Martinez and Michael Galvin.
Mr Galvin said: &quot;We believe that if you take away the 'pain' of business - the day-to-day essential services such as contracts, accounts, compliance issues, pensions and insurance - then the owner and driving force of the business is freed up to get on with what they want to do best - grow, nurture and develop their business.&quot;
Welcoming the jobs announcement, First Minister Alex Salmond said: &quot;By taking care of some of the day-to-day tasks SMEs face, Geniac will free up those who run businesses to focus on what matters most - growing their businesses.&quot; 
He added: &quot;The Scottish government is constantly working to make sure Scotland is the best place in the UK to do business, and I'm delighted companies like Geniac are taking advantage of it.&quot;
