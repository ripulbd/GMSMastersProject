Clyde Blowers Capital - owned by the billionaire Jim McColl - bought the yard earlier this month after it went into administration.
It has now secured a &pound;12m contract from the Scottish government to build a third hybrid ferry for CalMac. 
More details of the deal will be released later this week.
The yard has previously built two other hybrid ferries - the MV Hallaig and MV Lochinvar - for CalMac.
After concluding the deal to buy the shipyard, Mr McColl said he aimed to invest &pound;8m and employ up to 300 staff servicing the oil and gas, marine and renewables sectors.
He also said he hoped to have a workforce of up to 80 people, including all those who had been made redundant when the company went into administration, by 10 November.
He has renamed the company Ferguson Marine Engineering.
