We can exclusively reveal that Dante and the band will play the legendary venue on March 28 to celebrate the twenty fifth anniversary of their debut album Taking On The World which is being re-issued as a three disc edition with b-sides, rarities and BBC sessions next Monday.
Dante, who will be signing copies at Glasgow’s HMV Argyle Street that same day at 5pm, recalled: “I was sixteen when I first started and we played out our first gig at East Kilbride’s Bruce hotel where we were given chicken pies.
&quot;I remember digging it and from then on I thought you we not going to get me off the stage. I still get butterflies.
”It was 1990 when Gun first played the Barrowlands.&quot;

Dante said: “I was eighteen years old and headlining it was great. That year we were asked to join the Rolling Stones in Europe.
”The lads, who are working on a new album for the Spring can’t wait to play three shows at King Tuts for the Sunday Mail Centenary Fund on November 9,10 and 11.
Dante said: “I’m sure the fans will help if we forget the words. We have been playing new songs like Never Knew What I Had. When a song is fresh it’s exciting to play. That keeps you going too.”
