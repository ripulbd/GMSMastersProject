Dr Harbison was formerly head of business development at Edinburgh’s BioQuarter Dr Harbison was formerly head of business development at Edinburgh’s BioQuarter - Daily Record Edinburgh’s BioQuarter's former head of business development Dr Diane Harbison has been appointed as the new managing director of BioCity Scotland.
Lanarkshire-based BioCity Scotland, which opened in 2012, is a joint venture between BioCity Nottingham and Roslin BioCentre.
Dr Harbison, who has a BSc and a PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Glasgow and an MBA from Henley Business School, spent more than a decade with global pharmaceutical group Pfizer, laterally with its global business development group.
At Pfizer she was responsible for the negotiation and alliance management of a number of collaborations, notably for Pfizer’s first stem cell therapy for the treatment of macular degeneration with University College London which now has a product close to entering clinical trials.
On moving to head up business development of Edinburgh's BioQuarter, Dr Harbison's team established links with the University of Edinburgh’s academic researchers and some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.
This included two deals with Glaxo Smith Kline’s Discovery Partnerships with Academia (DPAc) which have enabled early drug discovery programmes in Acute Pancreatitis and Liver Fibrosis.
To date, the University of Edinburgh is the only university in the world to have two DPAc collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
BioQuarter also entered into strategic alliances with big pharma firms in other disease areas with the likes of Lilly, Biogen Idec and Astra Zeneca.
Dr Glenn Crocker, chief executive of BioCity, said: “Diane’s appointment marks an important next step in the evolution of BioCity in Scotland and enables us to further strengthen the way we work with early stage companies in the drug discovery industry.
“She brings a wealth of experience and an extensive network of connections, all of which will help to make companies based at BioCity even more successful.”
Commenting on her new role with BioCity Scotland, Dr Harbison said: “I am delighted to be joining BioCity Scotland at this exciting time.
“With major funding announced last month from Glasgow’s City Deal to establish MediCity Scotland, the funding will create a new med-tech incubator on the Newhouse site, providing a stimulating and supportive business creation environment for Medtech innovation.
“It complements our MediCity site in Nottingham and enhances what we can already offer prospective tenant companies.”
BioCity Scotland has already achieved 50 per cent occupancy on site, which it said is ahead of forecasts as outlined in its strategic plan.
A consortium of life sciences firms and research scientists based at the innovation incubator secured a &pound;100 million drug development contract in partnership with scientists at Dundee University to research new drug treatments under a scheme created by the European Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI).
The IMI is a public-private initiative designed to speed up the development of medicines.
BioCity is a large bioscience incubator providing facilities, finance and expertise to new science-based companies.
The site at Newhouse in Lanarkshire has space for 30 companies and the IMI contract will bring together their work to share the chemical compounds that form the building blocks of new medicines.
