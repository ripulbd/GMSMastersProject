SEVEN crime-hit streets in Glasgow's South Side are to be monitored by a new CCTV system. Here are the seven Glasgow streets put in focus with CCTV initiative SEVEN crime-hit streets in Glasgow's South Side are to be monitored by a new CCTV system.The Evening Times revealed in June that Govanhill was to get the cameras following a campaign by locals.Now the streets to be covered have been identified by Community Safety Glasgow (CSG), the city council's arms-length organisation which tackles crime.Busy Victoria Road, Allison Street and Calder Street will be monitored by CCTV, as well as residential areas Dixon Avenue, Annette Street, Garturk Street and Westmoreland Street.Govanhill was stunned by a spate of sex attacks earlier this year, prompting thousands of people to join a midnight protest march.A 24-year-old woman was allegedly raped in Dixon Road in May and in February a 26-year-old woman was subjected to a sexual assault in Dixon Avenue, near Victoria Road.In August, two men were reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with the incident in May.Walk organiser Ashley Crossan said: &quot;It's a great thing, these cameras. I don't know what goes through criminals' minds but I hope it will make them think twice. It also means police won't have to rely on CCTV from shops and pubs.&quot;Govanhill has been rocked by other serious crimes, including an attempted murder in Westmoreland Street in February, an attack on a frail pensioner in Calder Street in May and a gang brawl at Holyrood Secon-dary in the same month. Three school pupils were reported to the procurator fiscal and children's reporter in connection with an alleged attack on a teenager outside the school.More than 60 residents attended a stormy public meeting in June where police and politicians were told to crack down on criminals.Politicians later held meetings with Community Safety Glasgow and secured a commitment to install new CCTV cameras.The Evening Times understands work will begin in January and the new surveillance system will go live in the spring.Labour councillor Soryia Siddique said: &quot;Constit-uents have raised concerns regarding safety, crime and fear of crime at meetings with CSG and Police Scotland.&quot;It has now been confirmed that CSG has proposed seven camera installations for Govanhill.&quot;This is a step towards building confidence in the area and a welcome finan-cial commitment that will be part of the improvements proposed for Govanhill over the next few years.&quot;It is paramount that people feel safe and have a feeling of pride in their local community.&quot;Ward colleague, SNP councillor Mhairi Hunter, added: &quot;It will be a state-of-the-art system and it will help provide reassurance to people that they are going to be safer.&quot;The new cameras will be installed as part of an up-grade of CCTV across Glasgow.Chief Inspector Carol McGuire, area commander for the South Side, wel-comed the announcement.She said: &quot;CCTV is an effective tool in the preven-tion and detection of crime and the presence of came-ras will act as a deterrent.&quot;CCTV cameras will capture those involved in criminal activity which has a negative impact on our local communities.&quot;The Govanhill Service Hub provides an excellent facility to ensure a joint approach is taken to add-ress community concerns and our officers continue to work together with our partners to address local issues and to ensure that the community amenities can be enjoyed by all.&quot;The addition of this technology will provide an invaluable support to this.&quot;A council spokeswoman said: &quot;Govanhill, like the rest of the city, is set to benefit from the installation of new high definition CCTV cameras as part of the &pound;24million Future City Glasgow programme.&quot;Around 500 public space and traffic cameras will be going in across the city.&quot;CCTV cameras have proven to provide increased public reassurance and act as a deterrent to antisocial behaviour.&quot;peter.swindon@eveningtimes.co.uk
