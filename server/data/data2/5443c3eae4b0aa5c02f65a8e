CHART TOPPER George Ezra disappeared amongst the flora and fauna at Glasgow’s Botanic gardens on a trip to Scotland yesterday.
The Budapest hitmaker who is at number one with his album Wanted On Voyage decided to take in some local attractions before playing an intimate gig at the city’s Queen Margaret Union.
After spending the night on his tour bus, 21 year old George said: “I’ve not been indoors all day. We went to the Botanical Gardens and I went into a record shop.
&quot;It’s not that I’m into plants and flowers but its a nice thing to do and it’s free. There was a record fayre at the QMU and I bought one vinyl too.”
George was recognised by a few locals but was happy that they let him get on with his sightseeing.
He laughed: “It depends where you go. If you go into a shopping centre and stand people might recognise you but people don’t recognise me at other times.&nbsp; I think people appreciate that I’m out and about. They say ‘Alright George’ and give&nbsp; you a wave which is really nice.”
&nbsp;George, who is planning promo trips to Australia and the US in the near future, has been enjoying playing smaller gigs after appearing earlier this year at T in the Park.
He said: “T in the Park was so much energy and I was buzzing. It was one of the best gigs I’ve done. This has been really nice this because all the venues are of a similar size and it’s the first tour since the album came out.
&quot;I don’t pay attention to the charts until it happens but the album was out fourteen weeks before it went to number one, which was odd.&nbsp; The nice thing is it&nbsp; was discovered by word of mouth and people passing it on.”
