GLASGOW SNP councillors have thrown their weight behind Nicola sturgeon's bid to become party leader and First Minister of Scotland. All SNP city councillors unite behind Sturgeon GLASGOW SNP councillors have thrown their weight behind Nicola sturgeon's bid to become party leader and First Minister of Scotland.The 26-strong group has said it was united behind the Glasgow MSP and will be supporting her campaign should she face a challenge from someone else in the party.Ms Sturgeon announced her leadership bid in Glasgow on Wednesday at the Royal Concert Hall.The councillors said it will be good for Glasgow to have a city MSP as First Minister who has an in-depth knowledge of the city and the challenges it faces. Councillor Susan Aitken, Glasgow City Council opposition leader, has confirmed that the entire Glasgow SNP council group has made the unanimous decision to endorse Ms Sturgeon's candidacy as leader of the SNP.Ms Aitken said:&quot;I am delighted that every SNP councillor in Glasgow is endorsing Nicola as the next leader of our party.&quot;This decision came from the group members themselves, who were as one in wanting to put their collective weight behind my own personal endorsement for Nicola's candidacy.&quot;That Nicola will make a superb leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland is beyond doubt. Her record and talent speaks for itself.&quot;That she is also a Glasgow MSP with a deep understanding of the city's character and challenges is an extra bonus for Glasgow, but regardless of that fact, she is quite simply the best person for the job.&quot;The councillors' endorsement follows from the city's SNP MSPs almost unanimously backing Ms Sturgeon for the top job.On Thursday the Evening Times reported how six of the seven nationalist MSPs said they were supporting Nicola Sturgeon and the other, Shettleston MSP John Mason, said he would keep his vote to himself but recognised her talent and ability for the post.Ms Sturgeon has the support of most of the current Scottish cabinet, making a challenge for the post highly unlikely.If elected she will take over from Alex Salmond as party leader, then once he steps down as First Minister in November, she would be the SNP nomination for First Minister and become the the fifth First Minister of Scotland and the first woman to hold the post.hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk
