SET against the backdrop of WWII on the fictitious Western isle of Little Todday, Whisky Galore is the tale of a divided island community coming together to conceal an unexpected windfall of their beloved whisky — or ‘uisge beatha’ – from the authorities East Kilbride actors mix drams with drama in Whisky Galore - Daily Record East Kilbride actors Andrew Rodger and Robert Kirkham are mixing drams with drama this month.
They are starring in a new stage version of Compton MacKenzie’s much loved novel and film ‘Whisky Galore’.
“Most of the cast play multiple roles,” explained Robert. “I play crofter poet Duncan Macroon and protestant minister Rev Morrison, while Andrew goes from an ancient mariner to islander Jocky Stewart — who’s not the brightest but still manages to outwit the establishment when there’s whisky at stake.”

“It’s great to be involved in something so fresh and new and yet so familiar,” said Andrew. “All of the original, wonderful characters are there and the beautiful music really helps bring them, their stories and the atmosphere of the islands to life.”
Shop owner Andrew is having a busy year, having already played the role of Fagin in Oliver and performed in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games. Robert, who works for Scottish Power, is also no stranger to the stage, having starred in productions such as Guys and Dolls, Oklahoma and Fiddler on the Roof. However, this newest venture has a particular appeal.
‘Whisky Galore – the musical’ is running from Tuesday to Saturday, October 14-18, at Hutchesons’ Grammar School Studio Theatre. Tickets from Windmill Productions on 07831 445160 or at bookingmanager@windmill -productions.com.
