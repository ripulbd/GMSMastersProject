Kevin Bridges reveals he beat a gambling addiction thanks to advice from John Hartson COMEDIAN Kevin Bridges has revealed he beat a spiralling gambling addiction thanks to sage advice from former Celtic striker John Hartson.In his autobiography We Need to Talk About... Kevin Bridges, released this week, the 27-year-old millionaire stand-up comic talks details how he began betting obsessively.It was on a night out to a casino during his sell-out 2012 tour that Bridges first realised he was squandering all his hard-earned money.Talking to former gambling addict and Celtic star Hartson, however, finally convinced the comedian to face his own demons.Bridges, who grew up in Clydebank, says his betting habit started to grow after he first won acclaim on the comedy circuit in 2005.&quot;I was 18 when I discovered the bookies and then lost &pound;800 in one day,&quot; he writes. &quot;It was my first decent comedy club money and I blew it. I was gambling on coupons, machines, everything.&quot;I won a fair bit on a roulette machine and went out and bought a PlayStation.&quot;I took it back the next day because I felt like a flash b******.&quot;Like I'd turned into Kanye West or someone. Everything I made I was betting.&quot;I wasn't making that much money, thankfully, but it was becoming a bit of a problem.&quot;peter.swindon @evening times.co.uk
