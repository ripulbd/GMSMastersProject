A jailed drugs gang boss will lose his collection of upmarket watches to meet a court order to seize crime profits from him. Time runs out for city drugs thug A jailed drugs gang boss will lose his collection of upmarket watches to meet a court order to seize crime profits from him.Anthony O'Hare, 28, will be parted from three Tag Heuer timepieces and a Breitling, which will go under the auctioneer's hammer.The watches form part of a &pound;36,000 confiscation order made against O'Hare at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.The remainder of the sum will come from cash and O'Hare's interest in a house in Stepps, Glasgow.O'Hare and his gang were jailed for more than 20 years last year after police seized more than &pound;2 million of drugs and dirty money.O'Hare was heard telling henchmen how to avoid police surveillance, unaware that officers were listening on a wire tap.He was jailed for seven years for his part in the drugs trade and the judge who sentenced him, Lord Bracadale, told him: &quot;All the evidence suggests that you were involved in organised crime at a serious level.&quot;Police recovered high purity cocaine worth about &pound;1.3 million, along with &pound;700,000 worth of ecstasy and cannabis and diazepam type tablets.Following O'Hare's conviction the Crown brought proceedings against him to seize crime profits.His counsel, Mark Moir, told Lord Glennie that O'Hare had agreed to a settlement with the Crown in the proceeds of crime action.The court was told that O'Hare's benefit from general criminal conduct was more than &pound;405,000.But it was agreed that the available amount to be recovered from him was &pound;36,000.Mr Moir said that part of the settlement featured the three Tag and one Breitling watches. He said: &quot;They will go to auction.&quot;He said a fourth Tag watch, a ladies' model, was not the property of O'Hare and was to be excluded.The defence counsel said the final amount of the confiscation order may have to be varied depending on how much the timepieces make when they are sold.
