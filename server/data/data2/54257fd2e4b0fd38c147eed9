Theatre opening delayed until December A MULTI-million pound revamp of Glasgow's Theatre Royal will not be completed until December, seven months behind schedule.New delays have hit the construction of the building's new &pound;14m foyer, and it will not now open to the public until just before Christmas.It was originally meant to open in May, and then July, but further delays have forced the postponement of the grand opening.Shows in the theatre, home to Scottish Opera, will continue as planned, including performances of La Cenerentola, Cinderella Unwrapped for Scottish Opera, and the play Dangerous Corner.Alex Reedijk, general director of Scottish Opera, said: &quot;The contractors at the Theatre Royal are signalling that they need a little more time to finish the building - five or so weeks -which means we are now hoping to welcome the public into the new foyer in December.&quot;It is not known what effect the delay will have on the costs of the revamp. The building of the dramatic extension to the venerable theatre had been slowed last winter by bad weather, plus problems caused by its tight site on the corner of two busy Glasgow streets, and unexpected issues with the fabric of the Theatre Royal building.
