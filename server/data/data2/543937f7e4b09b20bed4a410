RUTH Geddes, 19, has spent more than 10 days in Parkhead Hospital in Glasgow, despite fears it will make her condition worse. Tribunal rules against releasing anorexic teenager from hospital - Daily Record AN ANOREXIC teenager is facing weeks on a psychiatric ward after a tribunal threw out a plea for her release.
Ruth Geddes, 19, has spent more than 10 days in Parkhead Hospital in Glasgow , despite fears it will make her condition worse.
In a last-ditch bid to secure her freedom, parents Eileen and Brian made representations at a tribunal, where they begged to take their daughter home.
But the panel refused their appeal and Ruth now faces at least 28 days locked on the ward until doctors review the decision.

Brian, 64, of Springhill, Glasgow, said: “We’re heartbroken. It was a close thing but it went against us. We are her parents and we’re powerless to do anything. How can that be right? It’s so frustrating.”
Ruth, from Riddrie, Glasgow, has been anorexic for three years.
Eileen, 55, insists her daughter’s health was improving before she was sectioned and sent to hospital for the third time. But she has lost weight since being admitted.

Brian said: “Ruth gave evidence during the tribunal and she was magnificent. She was very strong – she took our breath away.
“We feel terrible because we know that hospital is not the right place for her. The community would have been the right place.”
A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “Any detention is subject to review by the Mental Health Services Tribunal.
“This independent review has now been concluded and the decision to keep Ruth detained has been upheld.
“We are completely committed to acting in the best interests of Ruth Geddes.”
