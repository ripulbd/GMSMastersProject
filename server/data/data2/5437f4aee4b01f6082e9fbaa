Parties submit devolution proposals Scotland's political parties are due to submit their proposals to the commission tasked with agreeing more powers for the Scottish Parliament.The SNP, Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Greens have been given until today to set out their views on how the powers of Holyrood should be strengthened following the No vote on Scottish independence.Their submissions to Lord Smith of Kelvin's Scotland Devolution Commission will pave the way for cross-party talks to begin.Lord Smith has warned politicians that they must come to the table willing to compromise.In an interview with The Sun newspaper, he said: &quot;The success or failure of this rests with the politicians. I'm good at trying to get agreements from people with disparate views.&quot;But if there is material change from what's agreed I will be quite vocal about it. If I fail, they fail.&quot;There is no way I will satisfy everyone.&quot;Whatever we come up with won't be perfect from any one party's point of view.&quot;But it's got to be the right deal for Scotland and the UK.&quot;This won't be a lowest common denominator deal. It will be an agreement for substantial devolution of powers.&quot;He added: &quot;It may be a poisoned chalice. It may be that I say, 'Here are 20 things that all five political parties will sign up to. But sadly, there are another four or five that they couldn't agree on'.&quot;I think the politicians are showing good faith in this process. The Scottish people are saying something needs to be done now. I am going to work very hard with the politicians to get an agreement.&quot;Lord Smith was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron to lead the commission, set up in the wake of the independence vote to deliver on the pre-referendum vow by pro-union parties to guarantee more powers for Scotland.He is due to submit his report on further powers for the Scottish Parliament on November 30.Members of the public and campaign groups on both sides of the referendum debate have also been invited to contribute their views on the devolution settlement.Submissions can be made until October 31 by emailing haveyoursay@smith-commission.scot.The commission's first plenary session, which will be attended by representatives of all political parties, will take place on October 14 in Edinburgh.A special session of the cross-party talks will be convened after the deadline for public submissions, so these can be factored into the debate.Each party has nominated two representatives to take part in the process.The SNP will be represented by Finance Secretary John Swinney and MSP Linda Fabiani; Labour has put forward former Scottish leader and current finance spokesman Iain Gray and Gregg McClymont, MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East; the Conservatives will be represented by MSP and former Scottish leader Annabel Goldie and academic Professor Adam Tomkins; the Liberal Democrats by former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore and ex-Scottish leader and MSP Tavish Scott, and the Scottish Greens by co-leaders MSP Patrick Harvie and councillor Maggie Chapman.
