Pregnancy won't halt eviction A PREGNANT asylum seeker is today facing eviction from her Glasgow home, a refugee charity claimed.The Evening Times can reveal the young woman is due to be locked out of her city property, leaving her destitute and homeless.After she was ordered to pack up her belongings, an Ibrox-based charity issued an urgent appeal for help from local residents.Unity, an organisation that campaigns on behalf of asylum seekers, urged anyone who could give the young woman a place to live, to come forward.A statement from Unity read: &quot;We need to find somewhere for a pregnant asylum-seeking woman, in her early 20s, to stay for approximately one or two months.&quot;She will be made destitute on Thursday.&quot;This is just one example of the many where people are being evicted from their homes by the private housing providers contracted by the Home Office.&quot;Last month, we reported that support workers said one asylum seeker was forced to leave her home wearing only her pyjamas.Another said he was left without his belongings and with nowhere to go when he was locked out of his home at 7pm on a Friday.One campaigner said there had been reports of police being called to properrties to help evict people.Sheila Arthur, of the Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees, previously told of major concerns with the way asylum seekers were being treated.She said: &quot;I've heard about somebody who was in their pyjamas. She was told there was a gas leak, so they could get her out and the locks were changed.&quot;There have been cases of people having their locks changed when they're not there.&quot;I've also heard about cases where people have got half of their property, but not all of it because they've not been there to point out what is theirs.&quot;Anyone who can help Unity is asked to call the organisation on 0141 427 7992.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
