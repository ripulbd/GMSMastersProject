The event, now in its 41st year, is seen as piping's &quot;ultimate accolade&quot;.
The Glenfiddich championship is only open to those who have achieved success in other solo piping competitions earlier in the year.
Pipers from around the world converged on Blair Castle in Perthshire to take part in the event, which was established in 1974.
Mr Liddell said, &quot;Competing at the Glenfiddich Championship, you know that you are up against the best of the best, and there is no knowing what way it is going to go on the day. It is always going to be the smallest fraction that separates the winner from the others. 
&quot;It's an absolute honour and privilege to be here competing with such talent and I'll look forward to celebrating with everyone this evening.&quot;
