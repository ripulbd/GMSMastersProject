HARRISON was behind bars last night after police lifted him at his home in Glasgow and faces being hauled back to Spain to serve four years for triple assault in the Costa del Sol. Fallen boxing champion Scott Harrison's career back on the ropes as he faces return to Spanish jail after police swoop - Daily Record  FORMER world champion Scott Harrison ’s boxing return was dealt a massive blow yesterday as he was back behind bars awaiting extradition to Spain. 
The fallen champ was lifted at his home in Glasgow on a European arrest warrant and faces being returned to Malaga to serve four years for a triple assault in the Costa del Sol seven years ago.
Harrison, 37, will appear in court in Edinburgh today.
 Should he be sent back to prison in Spain then there are fears that boxing chiefs will KO the former WBO featherweight champion’s career just months after his licence was reinstated . 
That licence was returned by the British Boxing Board of Control on the basis that Harrison’s legal issues were over.
Harrison was sentenced in 2012 over attacks on two victims in the Malaga area five years earlier. He faced immediate arrest after an appeal failed last May
The judge who sentenced him said in his ruling: “He has been summonsed on several occasions to be notified he has to serve his prison sentence.
“He has not responded to any of those judicial summons and his whereabouts is unknown. Issue a European arrest warrant to ensure this order is complied with.”
