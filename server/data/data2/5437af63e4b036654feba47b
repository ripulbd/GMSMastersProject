&quot;I would appeal to Mr Kelly to give himself up and contact with Police Scotland with a view to handing himself in.&quot; 
Det Insp Hylands said Police Scotland would have &quot;an increased high profile police presence in the Drumchapel area&quot; until Mr Kelly is &quot;traced and arrested&quot;.
He added: &quot;At this time, members of the public are advised not to approach Mr Kelly but to contact police immediately via 999.&quot;
