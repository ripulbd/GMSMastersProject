THE group, who work in Glasgow and all live near each other in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, matched five numbers and one Lucky Star in last Tuesday's draw. Six construction workers celebrate after scooping more than Â£300,000 in EuroMillions win - Daily Record A SYNDICATE of six construction workers is celebrating after scooping more than &pound;300,000 in a EuroMillions win the first time they played together.
The group, who work in Glasgow and all live near each other in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, matched five numbers and one Lucky Star in last Tuesday's draw.
The &quot;Six of the Best&quot; syndicate members will each take a &pound;55,527.90 share of the &pound;333,167.40 win.
The men - Nigel Himsworth, 41, Adam Wright, 27, Ashley Robinson, 28, Adam Booth, 20, Michael Hunt, 31, and Darren Fisher, 42 - work for specialist contractor Kirk Environmental and have been in Glasgow for the past few weeks.
Mr Himsworth said: &quot;I buy a ticket for EuroMillions when it's a rollover and had bought mine one morning before work. A couple of the lads are new to the team and we were chatting and decided we would give it a go as a syndicate.

&quot;We each put on three Lucky Dips and on the Wednesday morning we checked our tickets. Four of us had checked our tickets on the way to work and when we arrived Ashley checked what turned out to be the winning ticket. We heard him shouting a mile away.
&quot;We had checked the tickets at 7am and the claim line didn't open until 9am so we were all pacing up and down until we knew everything was confirmed.
&quot;We're over the moon with our win. We went out for a celebration at the weekend when we were home and we were treated like pop stars. It hasn't really sunk in yet so no-one has decided what to spend their money on at this stage, but I'm sure there will be a few holidays being planned.&quot;
The winning ticket was bought from the Post Office and Newsagents in Dumbarton Road, Clydebank.
