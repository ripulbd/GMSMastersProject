A new hi-tech method is to be used to catch criminals - invisible paint. The invisible way to help fight crime A new hi-tech method is to be used to catch criminals - invisible paint.Scores of homes are to be issued with the paint, which shows up only under ultraviolet light.Smartwater systems have been on trial in some parts of the country, and have been used on vulnerable houses and cars.The odourless clear liquid is imprinted with a DNA-style code, and is brushed on belongings and valuables, including jewellery and watches.It has already helped to bring about a major reduction in housebreaking rates in other parts of the UK, according to designers behind the solution.SmartWater is almost impossible to wash out of clothes and can stay on the skin for weeks.Thieves can be arrested and prosecuted if the hi-tech solution is found by police on stolen items.Inspector John Gillespie, from Police Scotland, is leading the initiative, which will be used in homes in Rutherglen.He said: &quot;We are constantly being told by people that preventing housebreaking is a priority for them.&quot;We hope SmartWater will act as a deterrent, but if anyone is unfortunate enough to be targeted by housebreakers, the solution will give us a major start when we begin investigations.&quot;The property marking scheme is being extended across the country following a successful pilot project in Edinburgh earlier this year.Every household taking part will be issued with a &quot;uniquely coded&quot; bottle of SmartWater solution, which they are asked to brush on their valuables.Once applied the solution is detectable only under UV light. If items are stolen then police can identify the goods once checked under the light.The code within the solution provides what is described as an &quot;irrefutable forensic link&quot; back to the owner of the stolen goods - and also links the criminal with the crime scene.rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk
