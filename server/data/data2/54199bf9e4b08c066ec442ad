Gavin, who plays Boaby the Barman in the Craiglang show, was injured in an accident while cycling in Glasgow today.
The live version of the hit comedy, which will run for 21 performances at The SSE Hydro from later this month, will star all original cast members including Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill.

But sources close to the show insisted Gav's role in the much anticipated show isn't under threat.
The insider said: &quot;He's cracked his ribs and is on painkillers.
&quot;There's no way he's missing the show.

&quot;He'll be there. He'll just be there with sore ribs.&quot;
Hundreds more tickets were released for each show last month after the planned layout for the live production changed, freeing up 500 more tickets for each performance.
