I know he may be unaware as to what happened after he left, but I believe he will be able to provide important information which could enable officers to trace the suspect. I would urge him to come forward.&quot;I would also ask anyone who was in the area of Beechwood Road, Cumbernauld, late Saturday evening and perhaps remembers seeing the girl or the two men walking on that stretch of road to contact police.&quot;Equally, I would ask members of the public who recognise the description of the suspect or have any information whatsoever to telephone detectives at Coatbridge Police Office on the non-emergency number 101.&quot;
