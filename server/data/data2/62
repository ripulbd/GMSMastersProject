Lawyers in call for publicity on donor opt-out SCOTLAND'S top law organisation has called for a major publicity campaign before an opt-out organ donation scheme was introduced.The Law Society of Scotland has responded to proposals to raise transplant rates, which are backed by the Evening Times.It says a high-profile information campaign is vital to &quot;get it right&quot; before any changes to organ donation legislation.Otherwise, the Society warns, there could be conflict between patients' families and medical staff.The Welsh Government launched a two-year publicity campaign, ahead of the UK's first opt-out system being introduced in December next year.Alison Britton, convener of the Society's Health and Medical Law Committee, said: &quot;The proposed legislation would reverse current law so it is imperative to get it right.&quot;There are issues around individuals who have not opted out or expressed an objection to organ donation, but whose families raise strong objections.&quot;This could lead to clinicians facing the decision to remove organs in the face of strong objection or severe distress of family members.&quot;It is vitally important that appropriate education and training be given to a wide range of people, not only to the medical fraternity, but that a far-reaching and high- profile public campaign is put in place to ensure that any decisions made are fully informed.&quot;Anne McTaggart MSP has put forward proposals to introduce an opt-out organ donation system in Scotland, on the back of the Evening Times's award-winning Opt For Life Campaign.The Organ and Tissue Donation (Scotland) Bill would reverse the current situation and, following the lead of Wales, make it so that people are required to opt-out if they do not want to donate organs after death.Ms McTaggart said: &quot;We know that the role of the family is of real importance in the introduction of a 'soft opt-out' system of organ donation.&quot;The families' view will always be respected and that if they say no, then that is the view taken by the staff.&quot;The Law Society also backs the age for automatic opt-in being set at 16.The proposed legislation is supported by the British Medical Association (BMA).Dr Sue Robertson, member of the BMA's Scottish Council and a renal doctor, said: &quot;We would agree that a high-profile campaign to raise awareness of any change in organ donation legislation would be essential to ensure that the public are fully informed.&quot;The BMA has always maintained that donation should not proceed - even if the legal authority is in place - if it is evident that it would cause severe distress to the relatives.&quot;catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk
