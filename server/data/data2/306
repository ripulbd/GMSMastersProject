Interpol could help track down watch heist gang POLICE Scotland could call in Interpol to help track down the armed robbers behind a £250,000 designer watch heist.Detectives fear the stolen timepieces may already be bound for another country.The raiders took just 54 seconds to smash open window display cases in Glasgow's Argyll Arcade and escape with the haul of top-of-the-range watches.As revealed by the Evening Times, police said it was unlikely the items would be sold in the UK, as no reputable trader would touch them.Four balaclava-clad men, armed with sledgehammers and axes, targeted Glasgow's jewellery district in Buchanan Street last week.Officers from the international police agency can be brought in to help the hunt.A police source said: &quot;Officers can call in Interpol, if and when they need to.&quot;Interpol, the world's largest police organisation, has a dedicated operation -the Pink Panther Project -which aims to identify, locate and apprehend jewellery thieves.Bosses at the international police agency believe the Pink Panthers group is behind armed robberies targeting high-end jewellery stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and America.The &quot;loosely-aligned&quot; network of criminals is believed to have carried out robberies worth in excess of 330 million Euros since 1999.Hundreds of suspects are linked to more than 340 robberies in 35 countries across the world.There is nothing to suggest the recent raid at the Argyll Arcade is linked to the gang.It is thought the gang could have spent hours &quot;staking out&quot; Glasgow's historic jewellery mall before last Wednesday's raid.Police believe they made their escape in a white VW Golf car, which was later found abandoned in a car park in Townhead, near Glasgow Royal Infirmary.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland said: &quot;We will be examining all potential avenues for selling high-value watches.&quot;In this case, it is more likely the watches would be sold abroad, possibly over the internet.&quot;But the gang - who remain at large - will struggle to sell on the high-end timepieces in Scotland, or even the UK.It is understood that, unless they were stolen to order, the thieves will have trouble offloading them any time soon.The armed thugs targeted Rox, Mappin and Webb, Laing the Jeweller and Lewis Grant.Rox was the only store to have items, including Hublot and Bell &amp; Ross watches, stolen.Anyone with any information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
