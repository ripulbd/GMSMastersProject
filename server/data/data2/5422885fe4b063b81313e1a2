PARENTS at Hyndland Primary School claim controversial plans to redraw school catchment areas could have a "devastating" impact. Catchment area move sparks fury PARENTS at Hyndland Primary School claim controversial plans to redraw school catchment areas could have a "devastating" impact.Glasgow City Council has launched a consultation to discuss ways to ease overcrowding at Hillhead Primary, including changing boundaries.But Hyndland parents claim the new catchment could force the closure of a well used community hub to make space for extra pupils.And increased class sizes would, they say, have a detrimental impact on children's education.John Lewis, chairman of Hyndland Primary School Parent Council, said: &quot;The proposals for Hillhead Primary school could have a devastating impact on our school and schools in the surrounding area, such as Notre Dame, that use the out of school facilities.&quot;Hundreds of pupils use the breakfast club and after school centre at the Hyndland After School Club and there are 12 staff members.&quot;It would have a disastrous impact for families if this was to be closed and turned into classrooms.&quot;The building used by the Hyndland After School Club - 'The Afty' - is included in the school capacity figures in the consultation document.It sits in the grounds of the school but has been rented out for an out-of-hours club since 1992 and is used by more than 300 children.Parents say the council numbers do not reflect the actual capacity of the school once the Afty is taken out.If the building is to be used as a teaching space, then this could impact the breakfast club and after school &shy;provision for children at Hyndland and Notre Dame Primary, who also use it.Parents claim that to accommodate extra pupils six extra classrooms would need to be found. They worry this would mean transforming rooms such as the IT suite into teaching spaces.Glasgow's education &shy;department is seeking ways to ease overcrowding at Hillhead Primary.Consultation plans drawn up would slash the number of pupils entering the school to alleviate the problem.A Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: &quot;There is still time for all interested parties to respond and we would urge people to make their thoughts on the proposals known.&quot;
