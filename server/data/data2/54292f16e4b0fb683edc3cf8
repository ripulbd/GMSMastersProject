The Scottish SPCA said it was trying to re-home 32 cockerels that had been been rescued from various locations across Scotland.
One of the most recent cases involved four Transylvanian cockerels dumped in woods in Biggar.
The SSPCA said one reason behind the rise was people mistaking cockerel chicks for those of egg-laying hens.
Superintendent Sharon Comrie said the majority of the roosters in its care were dumped by their owners.
She said: &quot;People buy chicks thinking they are hens and, unfortunately, when they realise they are cockerels they often dump them as they can be noisy and don't lay eggs.
&quot;Cockerels are very territorial, so ideally we are looking to re-home them singly or in small groups to a home with a number of hens for company.
&quot;The cockerels will also need access to a secure run or a fully enclosed garden.&quot;
