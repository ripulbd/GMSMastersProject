Scots aged between 50 and 74 are being urged to take part in a national bowel cancer screening programme. Bowel cancer screening appeal made Scots aged between 50 and 74 are being urged to take part in a national bowel cancer screening programme.The Scottish Government wants as many people as possible to participate in the scheme as the cancer can often be cured if detected early using home screening kits.A public awareness campaign last year led to a rise in the number of calls to the national bowel screening centre and figures show that uptake of the programme has increased from 54% to 56% in two years.Currently 57% of bowel cancers are detected at the earliest stages and the new campaign hopes to increase that figure.Health Secretary Alex Neil said: &quot;We know that nine out of 10 people will survive bowel cancer if it is detected early.&quot;Completing and returning the home test is the simplest way to get checked - giving yourself the best possible chance of survival.&quot;However, only just over half of those eligible have taken the opportunity to get tested.&quot;Bowel cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, especially when it's caught early, and taking the test helps us to do exactly that.&quot;We want to encourage even more people to take up the services on offer and help further increase the rate of bowel cancers detected at the earliest stage, when people are least likely to need invasive treatment and most likely to survive.&quot;Sheena Edgar, 70, from Lanarkshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer after completing a routine bowel screening test three years ago.She said: &quot;I had no symptoms at all but I sent away my test anyway.&quot;Just a few days later I had a letter asking me to get in touch with the hospital to arrange a colonoscopy. They told me they found three polyps which were then sent away for testing.&quot;I then had an operation but was home three days later and felt like I was back to normal. It was all really quick.&quot;I'm very grateful for the screening service. Don't be put off doing the test - it's so simple and could save your life.&quot;Terence O'Kelly, senior medical officer and consultant colorectal surgeon, said: &quot;I know of many patients who have completed the home screening test, had a positive result, and have gone on to have polyps removed before they develop any further. These individuals have then enjoyed completely normal lives.&quot;Clearly not everyone has the same journey or outcome. However, what is clear, is that if detected early, bowel cancer is a form of disease that can be cured.&quot;For more information contact the Scottish Bowel Screening Helpline on 0800 0121 833 or visit www.bowelscreeningtest.org.
