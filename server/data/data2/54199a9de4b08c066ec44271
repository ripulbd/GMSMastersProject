ARCHIBALD Houston won a Medal of Honour for courage fighting with the US against Spain and now the Stars and Stripes flag used at his funeral is set to fetch £3000 at auction.   American flag that adorned Scots war hero's coffin in 1938 to go under the hammer - Daily Record A HISTORIC American flag that was draped over a Scottish war hero’s coffin is set to fetch thousands of pounds at auction.
Fugitive Archibald Houston left Scotland in the 19th century after a brush with the law but then won glory with the US Navy.
Houston, who was born in Anderston, Glasgow, won the Medal of Honour for his bravery during the US war against Spain.
He braved heavy fire from Spanish batteries to help scuttle a ship in Cuba, thwarting Spanish forces in 1898.
Auctioneer and Bargain Hunt star Anita Manning said the flag was expected to sell for &pound;3000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 

She added: “It may well attract a lot of interest from collectors in the US. Houston enlisted in the US Navy in 1898 at the outbreak of war between the US and Spain.
“Within six weeks, he’d earned the Medal of Honour, the highest military honour for outstanding bravery.
“On his death in Glasgow in 1938, the US government wanted to bury him as a hero in Arlington National Cemetery.
“But the family’s wishes for him to be buried in Glasgow were upheld. The US sent a delegation to the funeral at Glasgow’s Sandymount cemetery where this historical flag was draped over his coffin.”
