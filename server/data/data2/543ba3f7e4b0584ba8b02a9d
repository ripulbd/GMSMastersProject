Two-thousand workers at four Amazon warehouses in Germany have gone on strike until Tuesday in a dispute over pay and working conditions, according to the union Ver.di. Amazon workers in Germany go on strike over pay Two-thousand workers at four Amazon warehouses in Germany have gone on strike until Tuesday in a dispute over pay and working conditions, according to the union Ver.di.
The dispute centres on how Amazon classifies its warehouse staff. 
Ver.di says: &quot;Amazon pays wages which are lower than wages for staff in the retail or mail order trade in Germany&quot;.
Amazon classifies them as logistics workers and says that their wage is in the &quot;upper end of the scale&quot;.
Staff at Amazon's plants at Leipzig, Bad Hersfeld, Graben and Rheinberg will be on strike until Tuesday. 
Amazon said in a statement: &quot;Ver.di is calling for wages on the basis of a retail tariff. But Amazon's fulfilment centres are not shops frequented by customers. 
&quot;Staff in our fulfilment centres work within the logistics sector, not retail.&quot;
Responding to Amazon's comments, a Ver.di spokesperson said: &quot;The work at the fulfilment centre at Amazon is a classical part of the mail-order trade and therefore a classical part of the retail trade. 
&quot;Amazon's discourse about logistics is only to try to camouflage that Amazon is not willing to accept any collective bargaining agreement at all. 
&quot;Amazon wants to dictate unilaterally the working conditions, but the employees are not willing to accept that anymore.&quot;
Ver.di say wages are not comparable to other warehouse staff in the country.
Amazon employs more than 9,000 people in Germany. The German market is Amazon's second-biggest market behind the US.
Hundreds of Amazon staff walked out during the Christmas period in 2013.
