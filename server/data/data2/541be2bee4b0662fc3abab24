THE south side region's Town Centre Action Plan suggests having a public square in front of The Shed nightclub and Langside Hall. Glaswegians asked to get involved with Shawlands civic square creation proposals - Daily Record CITY bosses are proposing a new civic square for Shawlands – and are asking the public to get involved.
The earmarked space, in front of Langside Hall and The Shed nightclub, is already a bustling spot.
The plan is part of the &pound;3.3million Shawlands Town Centre Action Plan launched in 2012.
A council spokesman said the civic square “could form the heart of the emerging cultural quarter of Shawlands”.
He added: “The junction at Shawlands Cross is already home to Langside Hall – the key civic building of the area – and The Shed, which has a long track record of club nights, live theatre, dance and craft events.”
Projects delivered under the action plan so far include the Shawlands Gate outdoor digital animation studio, the designation of Shawlands Cross Conservation Area and footway and lighting improvements on Kilmarnock Road.
Council bosses believe a new civic square could bring Queens Park “into the heart of Shawlands town centre” and attract more visitors and business.
Residents can have their say at two events at Langside Hall – from 10am to 8pm on September 24 and 10am to 6pm on October 4.
