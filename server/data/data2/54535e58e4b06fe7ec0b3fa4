Eilidh helps to ring up Â£10k for children TECHNOLOGY expert Eilidh McSeveney was all smiles as she counted up the total cash raised for a children's charity.The customer service worker at NVT Group was part of a team of young apprentices who achieved their aim to raise &pound;10,000 to support vulnerable children and families in Scotland.The workers at NVT Group, based at Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, challenged themselves to raise a five-figure sum of cash for children's charity, NSPCC.Earlier this year they teamed up with their customers, family and friends and trekked up Ben Nevis in a charity climb.Their effort was particularly noted because the NVT staff have had one of the busiest years on record, helping to deliver the IT technology for the Commonwealth Games and golf's Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.The money they raised will help fund vital child protection services and helplines.NSPCC, the UK's leading children's charity, has a Childline base in Glasgow. It provides a free and confidential 24-hour helpline for children and young people.Picture: Mark Mainz
