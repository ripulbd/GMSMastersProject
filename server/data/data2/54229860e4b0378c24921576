The blaze broke out at the party's office on Poplar Road, in Broadmeadow Industrial Estate, at 21:50 on Sunday.
There was no-one in the office at the time but the cost of the damage is expected to be thousands of pounds.
Police said those responsible were &quot;utterly irresponsible&quot;. They want to trace two men on mountain bikes seen in the area shortly before the fire.
Det Insp David Moran, from Police Scotland, said: &quot;Setting this fire was utterly irresponsible, reckless and very dangerous. 
&quot;Thankfully there was no-one in the office at the time of the fire, however, the office was very badly damaged with a bill that will no doubt run into thousands of pounds to repair.
&quot;There are also a number of other small businesses in the area which could have suffered if the fire had taken hold.&quot;
Det Insp Moran added: &quot;I am particularly keen to speak to or identify two men seen riding mountain bikes in the area about 30 minutes prior to the fire being discovered and who may have important information. 
&quot;Additionally I would ask that anyone who has any information about the persons responsible for setting this fire to make contact with us.&quot;
