FOUR notorious tower blocks in Glasgow are to be pulled down and up to 60 new homes built in their place. Demolition of 4 tower blocks is triumph for locals FOUR notorious tower blocks in Glasgow are to be pulled down and up to 60 new homes built in their place.Glasgow Housing Association initially had permission to demolish two of the multi-storey blocks at Tarfside Oval in Cardonald, but has now announced all four are to go.A spokesman said they had listened to the community and it was clear they wanted all four pulled down.He said the flats, which have seen a series of police drug raids and a murder in recent years, had become unpopular and expensive to maintain.They are currently empty with all the tenants rehoused elsewhere.Glasgow City councillor for Craigton Alistair Watson said it was a triumph for the residents and &quot;one of the occasions when consultation has really worked&quot;.He said: &quot;The local community was totally, 100% behind the complete clearance of the site.&quot;There were deep-seated issues with crime. The level of crime was worrying people, it was spreading like a cancer. This is a unique opportunity to reinvent the area.&quot;Mr Watson, a local councillor for 20 years, said the flats, which at one time housed around 500 people, had started to decline in the late 1980s.He said the housing association had initially believed they could knock down two blocks and refurbish the remaining two but realised people no longer wanted to live in high-rise flats.He added: &quot;They want maisonettes or semi-detached homes now. I, the community council and the residents were all firmly of the opinion it should be a complete clearance of the site.&quot;He said it had taken time to move everyone out of the blocks since the plan for potential demolition was first raised more than three years ago.Since then, GHA staff have carried out face-to-face visits with every tenant in nearby homes and conducted surveys.A spokesman said &quot;the clear preference&quot; was for demolition and the development of &quot;new low-rise homes&quot;.GHA chairman Gordon Sloan said: &quot;This is great news for the community in Tarfside. It was clear the community wanted the blocks to be demolished and new homes built.&quot;The flats have become unpopular with local residents and would have been expensive to improve and maintain.&quot;The demolition of the blocks at Tarfside Oval will help us speed up the regeneration of the area.&quot;Demolition is expected to take place towards the end of next year, followed by work on the new homes.Contractors Dem Master are currently on site to start preparation work for demolition.victoria.brenan@ eveningtimes.co.uk
