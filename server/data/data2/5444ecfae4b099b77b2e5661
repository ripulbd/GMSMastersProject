Video: Ex-Celtic star John Hartson's gala raises £110k to fight cancer A CHARITY ball organised by former Celtic striker John Hartson has raised more than £110,000 for his cancer charity.The first John Hartson Foundation ball was held in Glasgow’s Thistle Hotel and marked five years since the 39-year-old’s life-threatening battle with testicular cancer.Scots screen stars Martin Compston and Los Angeles-based Scots actor and producer Gianni Capaldi, whose films include action-packed dramas Hard Rush and Blood of Redemption, were among the celebrity guests.Line of Duty star Martin donated the jacket he wore in one of his best-known movie roles as Glasgow underworld boss Paul Ferris in The Wee Man to the live auction.Celtic hitman Kris Commons and his partner Lisa Hague, former First Minister Lord Jack McConnell, and Waterloo Road’s Kirstie Steele – who plays schoolgirl Imogen Stewart in the BBC drama – also turned out to support John’s charity.John said: “I am astonished at the generosity everyone has shown tonight by helping us to raise this phenomenal amount. This means so much to me to see so many people turning out to support my foundation.“Just over five years ago I had my own cancer battle and I feel very blessed that I got through it.“Many people don’t, and I feel privileged that thanks to the amazing work of the doctors and nurses who saved me, I was able to get through it and enjoy seeing my five children grow up.“This is the third major fundraising event we’ve had in Scotland this year, and follows our golf day and BraveHart Ben Nevis Challenge and I’ve been overwhelmed by the support we’ve had from all the people who have worked so hard to raise money for us, not just as those events but by doing their own fundraising.“These range from young schoolchildren to individuals who have done daring challenges like skydiving for us and I’d like to thank every one of them. Every penny raised helps us make a difference.”Mrs Brown’s Boys’ star Gary Hollywood – who plays gay hairdresser Dino in the smash hit comedy and movie – and BAFTA award-winning Morvern Callar actress Kathleen McDermott hosted the sell-out gala.Gary’s on-screen partner Rory Cowan, who plays Rory Brown in the award-winning show, was also among the audience which was entertained by Westlife singer Brian McFadden, and X Factor’s Nicholas McDonald.Martin Compston is a patron of the John Hartson Foundation, along with Gary Hollywood and Celtic legend Murdo MacLeod.A donation from the proceeds of the event will be made to Children’s Hospice Association Scotland’s Robin House, Balloch.
