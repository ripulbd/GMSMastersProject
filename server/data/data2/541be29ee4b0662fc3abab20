'Yes voter' arrested in Glasgow's George Square for trying to climb on statue 'Yes voter' arrested in Glasgow's George Square for trying to climb on statue - Daily Record POLICE have reportedly arrested one man at a gathering of Yes supporters in Glasgow city centre.
Hundreds of pro-independence campaigners are partying in George Square tonight as votes are counted.
The celebrations are largely good natured with singing and music, while some people formed a massive conga round the square.
But a man was taken away by police after he tried to climb on to the Sir Walter Scott memorial in the centre of the square.
It came after another man tried to jump on to the monument - which is fenced off - earlier in the night.
Witnesses claimed the man was initially held by police but let go when fellow campaigners began to protest.
One witness said: &quot;The young guy tried to jump over the fence and police grabbed him.
&quot;But when they were trying to take him away, Yes people just jumped in and they had to let him go.
&quot;Then another guy tried the same thing later. But the police managed to get him away.&quot;
Police Scotland spokeswoman said that it hadn't been yet made aware of any arrests.
