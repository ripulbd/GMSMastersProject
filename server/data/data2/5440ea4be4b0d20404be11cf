 &quot;People were just hiding and it was disappointing to see and play in,&quot; he said after the 1-0 loss to Hamilton. 
 Looking ahead to this weekend's game in Dingwall, the midfielder added: &quot;I still believe what I said was right. 
 &quot;I am not going to change my thoughts on getting beat and being angry. I said everyone was hiding, not just some.&quot; 
 The defeat to surprise Premiership leaders Hamilton kept champions Celtic in sixth place, with 10 points dropped over eight matches. 
 &quot;You have to be disappointed and have it in the back of the head that you could have done something better and as a team we should have done something better,&quot; added Brown. 
&quot;There has got be to bravery on the ball. Everyone has to work harder as a group.&quot;
 &quot;The lads are all fine, there are no problems whatsoever. 
 &quot;Sometimes the truth has got to come out and it is not always the best thing. 
 &quot;But at the end of the day there are a lot of good players in that dressing room, they all talk and they all believe that we are a good team. 
 &quot;They have faith that we can go up to Dingwall on Saturday, start well and create chances. 
 &quot;There has got be to bravery on the ball. Everyone has to work harder as a group. 
 &quot;We have to press teams better, we've got to know when to close down and when to sit off, but we have been working on that on the training ground and had meetings about it so we have to look forward and be as positive as possible.&quot; 
 Asked if his post-match words had fired up his colleagues, Brown replied: &quot;We will see in the next few days, won't we?&quot; 
 &quot;Good teams get beat eventually, it is about how you bounce back.&quot;
