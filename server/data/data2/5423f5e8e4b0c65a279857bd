A BIKE belonging to Scottish stunt cyclist Danny &shy;MacAskill has been stolen from his van.


The cyclist discovered the theft when he went to get the bicycle at 5:30am yesterday. He has issued a plea for its return on his Facebook page, urging people to keep an eye out for it in the Glasgow area. He asked people not to “go rugby tackling” any child riding a similar bike.
Mr MacAskill wrote: “Went down to my van this morning at 5:30am to grab my bike (in its red EVOC bike bag) only to find my van had been broken into and bike and bag where (sic) gone which is less than ideal!! If you could keep an eye out for it around the Glasgow area that would be great!
“Mind and don’t go rugby tackling any kid riding a blue Inspired Skye off there bike! Mine have a pretty specific set up which I will post later. Cheers Danny.”
His post drew outpourings of sympathy on the social media site, with one poster Daniel Druce writing: “That’s like stealing Picasso’s paint brush! Sorry to hear dude!” 
David McNicol offered some hope, writing: “That is rubbish, on the bright side, they have pinched one of the most photographed bikes about, hopefully they get caught soon.”
