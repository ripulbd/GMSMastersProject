After illegally parking his marked vehicle, he popped into a sandwich shop before returning clutching a brown paper bag.
He was spotted by a shocked Daily Record reader in Craigton, Glasgow.
Our whistleblower, who didn’t want to be named, said it took place on Paisley Road West opposite Bellahouston Park last week at lunchtime.
They said: “I was outraged when I saw this guy.
“Craigton Primary School is just round the corner, and there were a number of kids around as it was lunchtime. There is no way little kids would have been able to see if any cars were coming.

“This numpty parked &shy;practically over the crossing.”
In one of the photos, the officer’s lunch is seen resting on the roof of the car as he opens the door to get in.
Our source added: “If everyone else has to abide by the rules, then surely so should the police as they are the ones who enforce them.”
Two years ago, Strathclyde Police’s then chief constable Stephen House said he wanted his officers to set an example to the public.
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland, who are now led by House, said: “Thank you for bringing this to our attention. It will be investigated and the appropriate action taken.”
