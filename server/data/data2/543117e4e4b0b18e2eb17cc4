 Haile Gebrselassie will return to Glasgow on Sunday to defend his Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run title. 
 The former world and Olympic 10,000m gold medallist won in the fastest time ever recorded in Scotland for the 13.1-mile half-marathon distance. 
 The 41-year-old Ethiopian's time of 61 minutes nine seconds was also a world age-group record. 
 But Joe Pavey will miss out on a chance to win the women's event at the same age after pulling out through injury. 
 It would have marked her return to the city where she won a 5,000m bronze medal for England at the Commonwealth Games. 
 A record 30,000 participants of all ages lined up last year in Scotland's biggest running event, which is televised live on the BBC. 
 Runners can choose between a 10,000m or half-marathon challenge through the heart of the city, starting in George Square and finishing on Glasgow Green. 
 The main women's event was won last year by Scotland's Susan Partridge.
