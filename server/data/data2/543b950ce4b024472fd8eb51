Lottery refuses £5m bid to restore Egyptian Halls A £5M LOTTERY bid which could have helped transform Glasgow's historic Egyptian Halls has been turned down.The bid for funding to help convert the derelict building into a hotel and shops was deemed too risky for the Heritage Lottery Fund due to uncertainties over other funding.But those behind a trust created to apply for the money say they hope to cut the risks and reapply within six months.Colin McLean, head of HLF Scotland, said: &quot;In its current form, the project presents unacceptably high risks to justify the investment of lottery funds.&quot;The division of the building into two separate projects and subsequent multiple ownership is a particular concern.&quot;In addition, the unconfirmed partnership funding also presents a significantly high risk.&quot;The bid was submitted in the summer by the newly formed Egyptian Halls Building Preservation Trust.The building in Union Street is owned by Dundee-based Derek Souter of Union Street Properties, and investors Kelvin Kerr and Duncan Souter.Even if the Lottery bid had been approved, more money would be needed.Historic Scotland has offered a grant of &pound;1.65m towards the project but a time-sensitive &pound;1m grant approved by Glasgow City Council in May 2010 lapsed in March 2011.Martyn Roe from the trust said it was now focused on cutting the risks and reapplying for a grant within six months.He said the HLF recognised the architectural renown of the building and economic growth potential that can be delivered by the project. &quot;That provides a platform to build a second application, which reconciles the risks identified,&quot; he added.The A-listed building, opposite the side entrance to Central Station in Union Street was designed by noted architect Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson (1817-1875). It has lain largely empty for three decades.Planning permission was granted by Glasgow City Council in 2012 to convert it into a 114-bedroom hotel with a two-storey extension, and to refurbish four ground-floor shops.Red tape and cash problems meant the &pound;20m project never got off the ground. Scaffolding has covered the building since 2009.victoria.brenan@eveningtimes.co.uk
