 The 20-year-old Scot won European team pursuit gold  on Friday, adding to her world team pursuit gold and national individual pursuit title. 
 But it was a third place finish in the 25km points race in Glasgow that brought most satisfaction. 
 &quot;That's the biggest,&quot; she told BBC Scotland. &quot;It was something I was looking at for a long time.&quot; 
 During her home Games, Archibald, from Milngavie, rode in three track events at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome as well as the road race and time trial. 
 &quot;When I first made the leap into top level track cycling, it was the Commonwealth Games that inspired me to get up and train in the morning,&quot; she explained. 
 &quot;With it being on the horizon for so long, to get the medal as a pay-off was fantastic.&quot; 
 Archibald says she is &quot;feeling good&quot; ahead Sunday's individual pursuit at the European Track Championships in Guadeloupe, the first chance to score Olympic qualification points for Rio 2016. 
 &quot;It's a heavy surface but I've done a lot of road work and it's maybe more relatable to that, so I'll give it a good crack,&quot; she added. 
 Archibald, along with Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell and Laura Trott, defeated the Russian team by nearly seven seconds in the team event final. 
 &quot;It's very different to the track we ride on in Manchester,&quot; she continued. &quot;It's concrete and very bumpy, so you need full concentration. 
 &quot;It's also very hot, the kind of heat that gets into your head.&quot;
