A new £50 million bridge has been proposed across the River Clyde in Glasgow New bridge planned across the River Clyde A new &pound;50 million bridge has been proposed across the River Clyde in Glasgow.

The road bridge would link Yoker, in the west of the city, with Renfrew and will slash travel times to Glasgow Airport.
Renfrewshire Council is leading the multimillion pound project, which is expected to begin in 2018 or 2019.
The bridge will open to let vessels pass up and down the river.
Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said it would be a “spectacular sight” when it is built.
The bridge will be paid for by City Deal cash, which was finalised in August and involves Westminster and Holyrood giving &pound;500 million of extra grant funding to the Glasgow region, following in the footsteps of similar deals for Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool.
The councils in the region are contributing &pound;130 million to the city deal.
Mr Macmillan said: “Renfrewshire is at the forefront of the &pound;1.13 billion City Deal programme, with projects to develop the long-awaited rail link to Glasgow Airport and further development at Clyde Waterfront/Renfrew Riverside.
“A road bridge connecting Renfrew and Yoker is another key project which will bring benefits to communities on both sides of the Clyde.
“The bridge will support further private sector investment and job creation, with improved access to investment opportunities at Glasgow Airport and Inchinnan Business Park.”
He said the cost is likely to be “in the region of &pound;50 million with a potential start date of 2018 or 2019.”
He added: “Obviously, things are at an early stage but it is likely that the design and engineering solution will need to accommodate some form of opening or moveable structure so that navigation can continue on the river.
“That should make for a spectacular sight once the bridge is in place.”
