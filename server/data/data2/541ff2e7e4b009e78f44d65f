FIRST Minister Alex Salmond has claimed that Scottish voters had been "tricked" into saying No to independence by a late vow of more devolved powers. Salmond: Scots voters were tricked FIRST Minister Alex Salmond has claimed that Scottish voters had been "tricked" into saying No to independence by a late vow of more devolved powers.He accused the three UK party leaders of &quot;reneging&quot; on their pledge, which he claimed won the No campaign.Mr Salmond announced his resignation on Friday after voters in Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45%.Now he has declared the &quot;writing is on the wall&quot;, claiming the &quot;Westminster gang&quot; are already going back on their pre-election pledges.Mr Salmond - who has identified the vow by the three Westminster leaders as being pivotal in the success of the No campaign - claimed the Labour and Conservative positions were now &quot;irreconcilable&quot;.He said: &quot;It's the people who voted No because they believed these commitments from the Westminster leadership, these are the people who are feeling most angry, most hurt, most disappointed today.&quot;The wrath of Khan will be as of nothing to the wrath of a No voter who has been gulled by the Westminster leadership.&quot;Analysis of figures from the referendum showed that the majority up to the age of 55 voted for independence, and a majority over 55 voted against.&quot;I think that vow was really important and the people who are really angry in Scotland today are not the Yes campaigners, our opinion of the Westminster elite is really pretty low. The people who are really angry are those people who were persuaded to vote No by that vow, by that solemn pledge and are now already beginning to feel let down, angry and disappointed because it looks like they have been tricked.&quot;When you have the majority of a country up to the age of 55 voting for independence, then I think the writing is on the wall for Westminster.&quot;I think the destination is pretty certain, we're only debating the timescale and the method.&quot;Concerns have been raised by nationalists that David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg will fail to keep their promise to deliver new tax and welfare powers to Holyrood in the timetable that has been laid out.The Prime Minister has stressed the need to link this to changes at Westminster, to ensure that only English MPs can vote on legislation which only impacts on England.But his insistence that the new settlement for Holyrood should go hand in hand with efforts to answer the so-called 'West Lothian Question', about the rights of Scottish and English MPs, has been met with wariness from Labour, which hold most of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats.It could also spark a fresh rift in the Coalition, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warning that Mr Cameron's decision to link the two issues could see him forced to renege on his promise to the people of Scotland.Mr Salmond said: &quot;David Cameron doesn't think he can carry his own backbenchers, never mind the threat from Ukip, unless he links Scottish progress to changes in England.&quot;Ed Miliband doesn't want to do that because Labour would lose their majority over English business in the House of Commons. That is the log jam the Westminster leaders got themselves into.There is a big issue there, but shouldn't they have thought of that before they made a solemn vow and pledge to the Scottish people?&quot;I don't see how they can be kept between David Cameron, who says they must go in tandem with changes in England, and Ed Miliband, who says they can't go in tandem with changes in England. These seem to be irreconcilable positions&quot;Mr Salmond also ruled out taking a seat in the House of Lords after he steps down.He said: &quot;My policy is to abolish the House of Lords&quot;, adding that &quot;rocks would melt with the sun&quot; before he would &quot;ever set foot in the House of Lords&quot;.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie urged Mr Salmond to &quot;calm down and take a bit of a breather&quot;.Mr Rennie said: &quot;On Friday the First Minister said he would work constructively with other parties.&quot;By the time he recorded his interview on Saturday he had changed his mind. Within hours of a result he said he accepted he showed that he just can't help himself.&quot;The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and senior political figures across the parties have been clear that a No vote at the referendum will not mean no to positive change.&quot;The First Minister still has a real role to play in the process on more powers, that is already under way, as promised. I hope that he will take some time for reflection and embrace the positive agenda for change rather than scrabbling round for a new grievance to nurse.&quot;Labour MSP James Kelly was also critical, saying: &quot;Alex Salmond has created divisions in Scotland where there were none.&quot;Now when the nation should be healing, the retired Salmond seeks to divide Scotland further.&quot;He should be true to his word and accept the result. Let Scotland move on without him rather than allow him to ferment division.&quot;Rather than speculate on how individuals voted he should accept Scotland's settled will.&quot;Instead of talking about tricks he must accept that Scotland refused to be tricked into separation.&quot;Scotland has spoken. Scotland will move on.&quot;Labour leader Ed Miliband said the pledge of further devolution to Scotland will be fulfilled &quot;no ifs, no buts&quot;.He said he and other leaders made a &quot;clear&quot; pledge of new powers during the referendum and they must &quot;honour&quot; it.Mr Clegg insisted delivering the extra powers could not &quot;be made contingent on other constitutional reforms&quot;.The Prime Minister insisted the timetable for further devolution would be met, stating: &quot;New powers over tax, spending and welfare are on their way to Scotland.&quot;The timetable is brisk, but achievable.
