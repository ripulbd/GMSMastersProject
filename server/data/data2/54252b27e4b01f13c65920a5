Social media search to hunt vote clash thugs SPECIALIST police are trawling social media to trace thugs involved in violent clashes in George Square.A team of officers were today combing hundreds of social networking posts to identify troublemakers who took part in the post-independence referendum rally in Glasgow.Experts have been called in to track &quot;riot ringleaders&quot; after trouble flared at around 9pm on Friday. Detectives are already searching tweets, posts and messages to gather evidence after claims thugs organised the mayhem.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland said: &quot;I can guarantee that there will be further arrests.&quot;We have a team of officers working tirelessly to identify and arrest those responsible.&quot;Sixteen people have now been arrested.As well as the online search, footage from dozens of cameras in Glasgow city centre has been pooled in a bid to map the movements of the thugs.Detectives have also had an &quot;encouraging response&quot; from the public to an incident that shocked Scotland.But Mr Sutherland urged anyone with any pictures or footage of the trouble to pass it to police.He said the scenes were &quot;extremely disappointing&quot; and left outsiders with a &quot;negative impression of Glasgow&quot;.The area commander said: &quot;Glasgow may be a city but it is also a community with people who live, work and visit. While I am absolutely committed to facilitating lawful and peaceful protest, I will not tolerate any behaviour which prevents people from going about their daily business.&quot;Our response to events on Friday is continuing at a pace with a major inquiry under way. A dedicated team of officers has been set up including specialists in inter-net and CCTV investigations.&quot;Sixteen people have been arrested so far. However inquiries continue and further arrests can be expected in the near future.&quot;The disturbance was described as an &quot;isolated incident&quot; after a largely trouble-free referendum campaign, which saw George Square become a meeting point for Yes supporters.Internet pictures showed flares being set off and a bottle being thrown at police officers. The mounted branch also had to be drafted in to deal with the disturbance.Fighting also broke out near the entrance to Queen Street station.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
