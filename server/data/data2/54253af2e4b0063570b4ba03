Partick Thistle not giving up on possible James McFadden deal  Manager Alan Archibald says the presence of James McFadden is helping Partick Thistle, even if he cannot yet afford a deal for the forward. 
 McFadden, 31, has been training with the Jags since he was released by Motherwell at the end of last season. 
 Archibald said: &quot;Financially, we can't offer James anything at the moment. 
 &quot;Even just having him around the place is beneficial to the team right now. You see glimpses of him on the training pitch when he is world-class.&quot; 
 Earlier this month, McFadden, capped 48 times for Scotland, said he was &quot;waiting for the right offer&quot;, insisting &quot;there's definitely a lot more football left in me&quot;. 
 Archibald may have spent his summer budget but has not given up hope on McFadden. 
 &quot;We are well covered in the area he plays,&quot; he explained. &quot;We had done our business before he came in to train with us. 
 &quot;But it's something we possibly might look at again further down the line. He is looking fitter and fitter, and the boys will tell you he has got these flashes of brilliance all the time in training, so it is something we will keep an eye on. 
 &quot;I watched him play for Scotland and admired some of the things he did. It's the same through the week when he is working with our boys. There are flashes of brilliance there and anyone can learn off him.&quot;
