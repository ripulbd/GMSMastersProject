RESPECT MP says Harvie was 'viperous' for saying that he had a history of 'rape apologism' during the Big Big Debate from the Hydro in Glasgow. George Galloway slams Patrick Harvie after the Green Party MSP attacks his character during TV debate - Daily Record GEORGE Galloway has hit out at Green Party MSP Patrick Harvie over personal remarks made during a televised broadcast on the Referendum debate.
Harvie, who was representing the Yes campaign with Nicola Sturgeon, claimed Galloway has a history of rape apologism during the Big Big Debate in front of a 10,000 strong audience of first-time voters at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow.

In our exclusive video interview George Galloway said afterwards: &quot;I didn't think it was a bad panel.
&quot;It was viciously personal in the case of the fellow from the Green Party.
&quot;I always thought they were cuddly liberal types but he was positively viperous and, of course, what he said was an utter misrepresentation of the truth.&quot;
Galloway also questioned the balance of Yes versus No voters in the young audience.
He said: &quot;It was very engaged. I think the young people were pretty strongly of one mind and I think the BBC ought to have made more effort in balancing the audience but nonetheless I'm happy to debate any and allcomers.
&quot;Having spent half a million of the public's money the BBC ought not to have allowed for that to happen. We put our debate for staying together as best we could.&quot;
