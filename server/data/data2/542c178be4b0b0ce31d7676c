SNP 'must learn No vote lessons' The SNP should quickly learn the lessons of the No vote in the referendum and rebuild the case for Scottish independence, according to prospective deputy leader Angela Constance.The Almond Valley MSP launched her bid to replace Nicola Sturgeon as deputy leader of the SNP in her constituency this morning.Ms Sturgeon, who is almost certain to be the next party leader and First Minister, has pledged to engage constructively with the Smith Commission on more devolution for Scotland.However, Ms Constance's press release is silent on the devolution process, insisting &quot;the debate on how we take Scotland forward is not about the Scottish Parliament or Westminster it's about our party, our members and the wider Yes movement&quot;.Ms Constance said: &quot;I have launched my campaign to become the next depute leader of the Scottish National Party in the constituency I represent and where I grew up.&quot;My roots are important to me and it was my experience growing up in West Lothian that led me to join the SNP at 18 years of age.&quot;I will always advocate that the SNP should remain absolutely focused on independence and while we don't know for sure when the opportunity to create an independent Scotland will next arise, nonetheless the SNP must continue to build the case for independence - head, heart and soul.&quot;The SNP is reinvigorated with tens of thousands of new members who have joined the SNP to campaign for independence.&quot;There is a new politics in Scotland and while I believe the SNP has a duty to lead the independence campaign, we have to recognise we don't have a monopoly on independence and we have to work hand in glove with the wider Yes movement.&quot;I have made clear that I am only seeking election as depute leader of the SNP and not the appointment of deputy first minister, which is purely in the gift of the new first minister.&quot;If elected deputy leader I want to focus on the needs of the party, our members old and new as well as the wider Yes movement.&quot;I want us to quickly learn the lessons from losing the referendum and to move forward the case for independence building on the participation and talents for all.&quot;The debate about how we take Scotland forward is not about the Scottish Parliament or Westminster, it's about our party, our members and the wider Yes movement. It's not about politicians or parliaments - it's about people.&quot;Her bid to continue the fight for independence could find favour with the tens of thousands of new SNP members who joined the party in the immediate aftermath of the independence referendum and attained party voting rights before the cut-off point on September 23.The deputy leadership election will be conducted by post and the successful candidate will be announced at the party conference in Perth next month.Ms Constance was recently promoted to Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women's Employment in a move designed to increase female representation in the Scottish Cabinet.With Nicola Sturgeon almost certain to be appointed the next First Minister, Ms Constance's bid raises the prospect of two women taking the top two spots in government if she is chosen as Deputy First Minister.Scottish transport minister Keith Brown and SNP treasury spokesman at Westminster Stewart Hosie are also in the running for deputy SNP leader.
