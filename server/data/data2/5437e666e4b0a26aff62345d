BAFTA-WINNER - who was jailed as a teenager - backs Glasgow anti-violence project. He reckons youngsters can stay out of trouble by learning new skills. Angel's Share star Paul Brannigan tells young Scots to steer clear of knife crime by getting creative - Daily Record BAFTA-WINNING actor Paul Brannigan yesterday urged young Scots to get creative to steer clear of knife crime.
The Angels’ Share star taught himself how to read after he was jailed as a teen.
And he reckons youngsters can stay out of trouble by learning new skills.
At the launch of the We-CTV initiative in Glasgow, dad-of-one Brannigan, 28, said: “It is vital in our society to get young people into creative industries and using violence as the talking point is a good way to do this. With the austerity cuts, we’re on the cliff’s edge in society regarding poverty.

“Further pockets of poverty will be created. Within those pockets, you have families with young people who want a normal life – and the way they get that is through crime. We need projects like this to show there are different avenues they can go down before it’s too late.”
Led by the Scottish Youth Parliament, We-CTV aims to educate and inform.
Brannigan added: “The scheme allows young people to become a writer, director or producer and use skills within their own communities to help educate others.”
