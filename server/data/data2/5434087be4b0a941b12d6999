In Pictures: Temporary roof installed at fire-damaged Glasgow School of Art A temporary roof has been installed at the Glasgow School of Art five months after the building was damaged by a fire.The roof is designed to cover the west wing of the building, which was damaged by the fire in May, and protect it during the winter months.The week-long operation involves assembling the large metal frame on the ground in Renfrew Street and lifting sections onto the building using a crane.Around 200 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze at its height, with crews salvaging 90% of the structure and saving up to 70% of its contents.Students were putting the final touches to their end-of-year projects when a blaze broke out on May 23 in the basement of the building designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh more than a century ago.
