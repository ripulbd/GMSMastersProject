SCOTLAND Minister David Mundell claimed the referendum result may have been different if Yes campaigners had spent less time protesting about biased coverage. Tory minister accuses Yes protesters of 'intimidatory behaviour' in lead up to referendum - Daily Record IF Yes campaigners in Scotland's independence referendum had spent less time protesting about biased coverage and more time canvassing in the streets, the result might have been closer, Scotland Minister David Mundell has claimed.
The Tory minister criticised those who protested outside Glasgow's BBC headquarters against allegedly-biased coverage as he stressed that &quot;intimidatory behaviour&quot; did nothing to further the cause of those seeking independence.
Scotland voted against becoming an independent country by 55 per cent to 45 per cent last month.
Mr Mundell was replying to a question from Liberal Democrat deputy leader Sir Malcolm Bruce, who highlighted &quot;intimidating&quot; behaviour on one visit to Scotland.
 

The minister told the Commons: &quot;You are absolutely right to highlight the fact that this sort of intimidatory behaviour, bad behaviour in the street and on the internet did nothing to further the cause of Yes Scotland.
&quot;In fact, if demonstrators had not been outside the BBC but perhaps knocking a few doors on the Sunday before the referendum, the result might have been closer.&quot;
