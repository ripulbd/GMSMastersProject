ED MILIBAND has warned Scots that an independent Scotland could face £1billion spending cuts to the NHS, the equivalent of 36,000 nurses. Independence Referendum: Labour leader, Ed Miliband warns Yes vote will cost Scotland's NHS £1billion - Daily Record THE NHS face a &pound;1billion battering under independence, Ed Milliband warned last night.
The Labour leader said splitting would cost the health service enough to fund 36,000 nurses.
He said Alex Salmond’s “lack of a currency plan” could lead to &pound;21billion of spending cuts in an independent Scotland, according to Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

He told a referendum rally in Glasgow: “Be in no doubt what this means: more than &pound;1billion a year would be the NHS’s share of those cuts, the equivalent of 36,000 nurses. That is the real threat to NHS.”
Better Together yesterday released a letter signed by 200 Scottish NHS professionals saying the Scottish NHS will be better protected within the Union
It read: “We love our NHS and believe that working for it, as we all do or have done, is both a privilege and an act of service to fellow citizens.
 

“We are living through tough financial times and can ill afford the additional cuts that would surely come should Scotland choose the risk of independence ahead of the broad shoulders of the UK.” At the Royal Concert Hall, Miliband said voting No on Thursday would bring about a “faster, better, safer change” for Scotland under Gordon Brown’s fast-track plans than voting Yes.
Brown, who is spearheading the timetable for more devolved powers, joined Miliband on stage for the first time since stepping down as Labour leader.
