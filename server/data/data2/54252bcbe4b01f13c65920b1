City thinks smart with Â£24m drive PEOPLE in Glasgow are being shown how new technology will make city life smarter and safer.Interactive hubs packed with films, apps and pioneering technology from Future City Glasgow will pop up around the city from today.Glasgow beat 29 other UK cities to win &pound;24million to turn innovative concepts into reality.Among the showpiece &shy;designs are new street lights that react to noise and movement and will alert emergency services to any problems.The lighting scheme will &shy;involve sensors being installed on lighting columns which will collect information such as footfall as well as air and noise pollution levels.City council bosses say that would speed up police &shy;response times, making the city centre safer.Buchanan Street and the Riverside Museum will be the first locations to host hubs where the public can drop in to find out about the new technology.There will also be a chance to get a behind-the-scenes peak at Glasgow's world class operations centre.The centre brings together images from hundreds of CCTV cameras across the city, in a new partnership between Traffcom and Community Safety Glasgow.Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council, said: &quot;These interactive exhibitions are exciting ways for people to explore the Future City Glasgow projects and find out what they mean for their families or businesses.&quot;The word 'data' can sound daunting but people access it every day - possibly without realising it and the hubs will explain the opportunities &shy;offered by greater sharing and smarter use of data.&quot;Hubs in Buchanan Street will be open until October 18 and at the Riverside Museum until October 4.They will be followed by more pop-up hubs in Pollok Civic Realm, Cowglen Road, the Bridge, Easterhouse and Mitchell Library.For more information go to http://futurecity.glasgow.gov.uk/ and follow the links.caroline.wilson@eveningtimes.co.uk
