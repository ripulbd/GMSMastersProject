A REPRODUCTION of two doors to the Mackintosh Building is one of the works on display at this year's event. Glasgow School of Art degree show features touching tribute to fire-ravaged iconic building - Daily Record A LATEX reproduction of two doors to The Mackintosh Building is just one of the artworks on display at this year’s Glasgow School of Art Degree show.
The touching tribute to the famous fire-ravaged building in Glasgow forms part of a work by artist Teresa Malaney exploring a sense of loss.&nbsp;
Student Teresa Malaney explained: “The concept in my work is about consciousness, the mind and plasticity of the brain and this present work relates to the memory and recollecting, specifically because the fire brought in all of us a resurgence of past memories of this building.
&quot;The doors are fragments of a greater whole and are still intact and are important as a memory.”&nbsp; 
 

The installation by Teresa at Glasgow’s McLellan Galleries joins other artworks by Masters students on programmes across Architecture, Design, Fine Art and Creative Practice.
 

The show, which is being hosted by the Galleries and the new Reid Building also boasts racks of ladies underwear and an artwork by Chinese student Lin Mi which allows art lovers to create their own computerised tree drawing from the carbon articles in their breath.
 

Other pieces to look out for are a film made in Barlinnie, 3D recreations of 1930s Finnieston and Parliament House and giant moths made from collected and reformed organic matter.
The show run from September 6 to 12.
