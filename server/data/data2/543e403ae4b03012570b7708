DETECTIVES looking for Kelly will appear on Crimewatch tomorrow night to ask gangsters to hand over the runaway prisoner. Police hunting runaway prisoner Jonathan Kelly to appear on Crimewatch in bid to find machete thug - Daily Record POLICE are to go on Crimewatch tomorrow to ask gangsters to hand over fugitive machete thug Jonathan Kelly .
Kelly vanished in August after being freed early from jail. He earned a return to prison by cutting off his electronic tag – breaching his strict release conditions – but police can’t find him.
It’s believed fellow-crooks in Edinburgh are hiding the thug , who has reportedly vowed to murder police like crazed one-eyed killer Dale Cregan if he is cornered .
Detectives looking for Kelly will appear on Crimewatch tomorrow night and ask any viewers who know where he is to get in touch.
Kelly, 34, was originally jailed for paralysing a man in a machete attack. He later boasted of a string of brutal assaults while in prison .
He is from Drumchapel in Glasgow but police have been told he could be hiding in the capital with associates of drug baron Mark Richardson.
As a result of the intelligence, police warned former boxer Robert Kelbie that his life may be in danger . Richardson and Kelbie have been involved in a bitter feud for years.
Kelly is being linked with a bungled gangland gun attack on a family home in Edinburgh last week.
Police claim he is not a danger to the public but admit he “may pose a risk”,
Labour justice spokesman Graeme Pearson has written to Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill to ask why Kelly was freed early, when MacAskill was told about his disappearance and what he did about it. MacAskill is away on holiday.
The BBC confirmed: “Crimewatch intend to feature an appeal to locate Jonathan Kelly.”
