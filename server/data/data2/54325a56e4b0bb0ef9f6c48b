Council tightens rules over parade marshalls RULES covering marshalls who keep order at the hundreds of parades which take place in Glasgow each year are to be tightened up.The city council recently reviewed its policy on parades and consulted a wide range of affected organisations.These included community councils, all the main parade organisations, religious groups, transport operators, shopping centres, the Chamber of Commerce and the police.As a result, a number of changes have been made to the parade policy drawn up by the council.All marches must have one steward or marshall to every 10 people taking part.The council is now demanding they must all be trained at a standard agreed by the local authority.Stewards must be briefed by the organiser and given guidance and instruction in their role. They must carry proof of status and co-operate with the police and take instructions from them.All marshalls must wear suitable clothing to make themselves easy to identify and conduct themselves in a proper manner.A report to councillors says: &quot;The policy currently requires all procession organisers must ensure a ratio of one steward to every 10 participants.&quot;This has generally been accepted and through the efforts of the principal marching organisations and Police Scotland, substantial progress has been made in raising the numbers and quality of trained stewards.&quot;This contributes to a well-run procession which allows the police to concentrate more effectively on other aspects of parade management.&quot;There is, however, room for further improvement, especially across organisations less used to parading on a regular basis.&quot;The new rules says &shy;anyone under the influence of alcohol or drugs must not be allowed to take part in a parade.But the restriction banning parade bands from playing near to places of worship has been relaxed.The previous policy restricted the playing of music before 9am and after 6pm and on passing places of worship, whether or not a service was under way in the building.Some organisers questioned the policy, saying it should be relaxed and should only apply when services were being held.The report says: &quot;They considered the current total ban on playing music on passing places of worship, including not permitting the marking of time by a drum beat, caused problems in keeping to time and formation and introduced delays to the passage of parades.&quot;Processions will continue to be told to stop playing music when approaching or passing places of worship, irrespective of whether or not a service is in progress.The 100m quiet zone on either side of the buildings will continue to be implemented.But bands leading processions will be allowed a single tap on a single snare drum.Last year, 390 organisations marched through the city compared to almost 500 in 2009.vivienne.nicoll@eveningtimes.co.uk
