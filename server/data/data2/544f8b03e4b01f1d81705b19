THE man behind Britain’s Olympic cycling success has urged Scots to vote No in the referendum, arguing that the UK's sporting successes have been achieved by sharing talent and resources. Independence referendum and Scottish sport: Cycling chief Sir Dave Brailsford says ' for the sake of UK sport I hope you vote no' - Daily Record DAVE BRAILSFORD, the coach behind Britain’s Olympic cycling success, has urged Scots to vote No in the referendum “for the sake of UK sport”.
The 50-year-old led Team GB to eight gold medals at both the Beijing and London Games, with Scots star Chris Hoy the undoubted talisman.
The Edinburgh ace is the most decorated Olympic cyclist of all time, boasting six golds and one silver.
Without him, Team GB wouldn’t have enjoyed the same stunning success and Brailsford believes sharing talent and resources helped the UK top the cycling medal table in 2008 and 2012.
So the head of Team Sky cycling would be disappointed if Scots aren’t part of the team at Rio 2016. Brailsford said: “Scotland has been a huge part of the success of British cycling.
“I hope the UK stays together for the benefit of all sport – but especially Olympic sports like ours.
“UK sport is one of the best things this country has and it is all possible because we can share talent, resources and ideas.
“I was born in England but raised in Wales with Welsh as my first language.
“I feel passionately Welsh, English and British – and I feel that all the countries of the UK are a big part of my national identity.
“My message to friends in Scotland is simple, ‘It is for you to decide your own future but for the sake of UK sport I hope you vote No’.”
