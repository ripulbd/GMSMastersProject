A YOUNG trade unionist has come up with a new plan to help his peers find work. Usman wants to help others on journey to secure work A YOUNG trade unionist has come up with a new plan to help his peers find work.Usman Ali, 23, a member of GMB Scotland, has developed The Employment Journey programme.It aims to identify what more can be done to get young people into work.The journey has four steps: seeking work, securing a job, staying in employment and succeeding in that post.It is hoped this new approach will bring all key players together and inform government policy.Usman, who is also chairman of the Scottish Trades Union Congress Youth Committee, said: &quot;We want to promote a grown up approach to looking at employment in Scotland.&quot;We recognise today's harsh economic choices in Scotland and we recognise our role in helping. Our focus is on finding ways to be more effective with less and be more efficient.&quot;GMB Scotland's Regional Secretary Harry Donaldson, is backing the initiative.He said: &quot;It is an interesting way to address the challenges facing central and local government, employers, employees, educationalists and service providers.&quot;Usman's work gives us encouragement that Scotland's young people, young workers and young trade unionists are serious about the future of our country.&quot;
