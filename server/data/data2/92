Diplacito and Glancy sentenced over Green Brigade march Two men who were among 13 people held by police during a march by the Green Brigade group of Celtic fans have been given one year football banning orders.
Nicholas Diplacito, 29, from Lanark, and Mark Glancy, 24, from Glasgow, were arrested during the unofficial march in the Gallowgate area on 16 March 2013.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard they behaved in a threatening manner and struggled with police officers.
Diplacito must also carry out 135 hours of unpaid work. Glancy was fined &pound;630.
Stephen Ferguson, football liaison prosecutor for the west of Scotland, said: &quot;These men were part of a disorderly crowd and seemed intent on causing trouble. Such shameful behaviour will not be tolerated. 
&quot;Police officers carrying out their important role in maintaining public order should not be subjected to assault and abuse or hindered and obstructed and we will continue to do all in our power to bring those who perpetrate such crimes to justice.&quot;
Almost 200 officers were deployed to the gathering outside the Chrystal Bell pub in Glasgow's Gallowgate area prior to the Celtic v Aberdeen match last year.
At the time, police said the crowd &quot;appeared to be attempting to stage an illegal street procession and officers were deployed to prevent this&quot;.
The Green Brigade had posted on its website ahead of the protest that it would be holding a &quot;corteo to Celtic Park to raise awareness and show support for the growing list of Celtic supporters receiving and facing bans&quot;. 
It warned those taking part that police would &quot;use every and any excuse to instigate trouble&quot;.
