Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice to hold local drop-ins Hospice to hold events in Cambuslang and Rutherglen - Daily Record The Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice is inviting the public to learn about its work in Rutherglen and Cambuslang next month.
As part of Hospice Care Week 2014, and&nbsp; sponsored by Harndec Flooring Company, the hospice is inviting the public along to the Town Hall and Cambuslang Institute, at two public events to raise awareness about hospice services in the area.
They will be in Rutherglen Town Hall on Tuesday, October&nbsp; 7, from 3-8pm, and at the Cambuslang Institute on&nbsp; Thursday, October 9, from 3-8pm.
&nbsp;A spokesman said: “For over 30 years the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice has served the populations of south Glasgow, Rutherglen and Cambuslang. Over this time there have been many changes and developments in Hospice services, but the core element of care has not changed.
“Our team are dedicated and expert in the care and support we offer, to support people to live as well as they can for as long as they can.
“The events will include an exhibition about current hospice care, with a range of information about the services and support we offer to our patients and their families in your community. We will also share our plans for our new home at Bellahouston Park, including a our 3D flythrough of the new build.
“Part of the purpose of these events is to remind our communities that we are the local hospice for them. We also want to give an opportunity to explore some of the challenging conversations around hospice care, and we will have a team of staff on hand to chat with our visitors at the events.”
The hospice is hosting a conversation caf&eacute; with cakes to go with the tea or coffee, and encouraging people to drop in at any time between 3pm and 8pm and meet the team, find out more and answer the question, ‘what is hospice care?’
