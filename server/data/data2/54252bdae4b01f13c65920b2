Top cop Ellie Bird is flying off to Kenya to help young women with charity work for Vision Africa SHE has had a distinguished career in policing, but now Chief Superintendent Ellie Bird is starting a new- but equally challenging - chapter of her life.After 34 years with the police force, Ellie is moving to Kenya to carry out charity work helping young women have a positive future, and the unusual move will see her work in impoverished townships, bringing hope and opportunities to girls.She said: &quot;For many years throughout my police career I have played a key role in improving the representation of women in policing, much of which has been achieved through coaching, mentoring and a focus on leadership roles.&quot;Operationally I have dealt with crimes of physical, sexual and emotional abuse against children and young women, as well as developing campaigns and initiatives to tackle domestic violence&quot;I believe that women have the right in defining their own future and that of their families and communities.&quot;In Kenya that is critical given the number of girls who are married at such a young age and are expected to fulfil so many cultural expectations.&quot;I have met so many young girls who are determined to complete their education, aspiring to be doctors, engineers and lawyers.They face the challenge of being told by their own teachers that these are not roles that women should perform and those who are first born are expected to provide for their siblings and to fund their education.&quot;Ellie, Area Commander for Scotland for British Transport Police (BTP), became involved with charity Vision Africa through friends, and made her first trip to Kenya in October last year.On Saturday she goes to Kenya for her fifth trip to the country with the children's organisation.Then, in October, she moves there indefinitely to develop an arm of the charity working to change the fortunes of young girls.In between these visits she will also travel to Pakistan, where she has been asked by the Ministry of the Interior to advise on ways of expanding the role of the police.She added: &quot;Each time I visited Kenya I realised just how much we take for granted. Hundreds of young girls cannot access suitable sanitary wear and with no washing facilities at school they simply have no choice; their education is disrupted.&quot;Some of the men, in gangs within townships, have realised the value of a sanitary towel as a commodity and many girls are subject to rape or forced to commit crime in exchange.&quot;After sharing this with friends and colleagues I have been able to secure some funding and we have established Girls Empowered; a group of more than 250 girls in Kibera who meet weekly.&quot;Young women who attend Girls Empowered are given access to health education and support through peer mentoring.Ellie also works with St Andrew's Baby Care Unit, which looks after babies who have been orphaned or abandoned.She said that in one month the unit took in three baby girls, one of whom was rescued from a river where she had been left by her mother.Vision Africa also runs Seed of Hope, which provides vocational training for young people from disadvantaged families.Ellie, who finances all of her travel by herself, says it is vital to show teenagers and children support that they can persue their dreams.Although she is excited about the opportunity to work in Kenya, Ellie said she will miss Glasgow, particularly having just been part of the policing team for the Commonwealth Games.In an incredibly varied career, she said key points included responding to terrorist incidents, a train derailment and tackling sectarianism on the rail network as well as being part of a team of detectives that secured a life sentence for a serial rapist.But, having celebrated the milestone with friends and colleagues, she is looking forward to a challenging retirement.Ellie added: &quot;I have been involved in numerous initiatives over the years to tackle crime and to try and solve problems, but never would I have considered the provision of sanitary towels and underwear as a means to tackle sexual abuse. I am excited about working in an environment where I am challenged and the solution is different.&quot;I really believe that there is so much more to be done and so much more that we can achieve.&quot;Their welcome has been overwhelming and already Kenya feels like home and indeed it will be in October.&quot;During my last visit, one of the students said to me: 'Before I came to Seed of Hope I was just a girl. Now I have learnt something and I am proud, I am happy and I know I can do something good'.&quot;
