A SUCCESSFUL new Glasgow company is setting its sights on its next big target area ... Tummy Mummy has stomach for international expansion A SUCCESSFUL new Glasgow company is setting its sights on its next big target area ...the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.Gerry Abrahams, director of Tummy with Mummy Ltd, says the company, which she runs with sons Mike and Dave, hopes to win new custom in the UAE, which includes Dubai and Abu Dhabi.The company was represented at a trade mission there by Mike.The visit was organised by UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) in partnership with Santander UK and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. The UAE is viewed as an increasingly attractive market for Scottish firms. The trade mission aimed to break down potential barriers and stimulate exports and international growth for the eleven firms that made the trip.Tummy with Mummy has sold in the region of 10,000 units of what it describes as &quot;the world's only foldaway baby and toddler seat with a 'tummy time' platform.&quot;'Tummy time' is a throwback to a childcare routine that involved babies being placed on their stomachs during waking hours.Says Gerry: &quot;Tummy time was very popular when my own five children were small but it became less common in the early 1990s.&quot;Babies began spending too much time on their backs, sometimes with their heads resting against car seats and other hard surfaces. This led to an increase in what is known as flat-head syndrome and delayed motor responses.&quot;Gerry's response, which evolved over several years, was the foldaway seat.Many purchasers have responded favourably to it.Gerry visited New York and Boston two years ago as part of another Santander Breakthrough visit.&quot;This is an excellent opportunity for us&quot; says Gerry of son Mike's six-day trip.&quot;The UAE is a major market for our product. We already trade there, but this mission will open more doors.&quot;Talks have been arranged with several important health and education organisations that have indicated their interest in our child development products.&quot;We have also recently clinched a French deal, which is great news, with another deal pending.&quot;John Williams, Head of Breakthrough at Santander, said: &quot;Abu Dhabi and Dubai have become enticing markets for fast-growth UK businesses.&quot;
