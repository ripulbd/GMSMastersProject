Film night will help the hungry STAGE and screen star David Hayman has urged Glasgwegians to do whatever they can to support hungry families this winter.The actor has come out in support of the Evening Times Food for Thought campaign, which is raising awareness of food banks.Later this month the charity he founded in 2001, Spirit Aid, will host a one-off film screening to raise funds to feed people in need and to give poverty-stricken families toys for Christmas.They will show the 1979 film, A Sense of Freedom, in which David took the lead role as Glasgow killer turned artist Jimmy Boyle.All proceeds from the October 26 event will go to Spirit Aid's Christmas appeals.David said: &quot;Many thousands of children in Glasgow dread Christmas. An ice cream is a rarity to these kids never mind a wrapped gift from Santa or a trip to a pantomime. It is these children we must reach.&quot;They are going to feel like the underclass.&quot;A lot of people will struggle all year.&quot;All donations from this event will go towards our Glasgow Christmas projects.&quot;The charity's Christmas Hamper Appeal has helped feed thousands of homeless people throughout the city over the past 10 years.David, who grew up in Drumchapel, launched it because he recognised the huge social problems in Glasgow.Recent figures show 35% of children in Glasgow are living below the poverty line, compared to the national rate of 25%.The project is run by a team of dedicated volunteers who, this year, will fill around 500 food sacks, as well as providing new toys to 500 children housed in protection or living in extreme poverty.David says he is backing our food banks campaign &quot;wholeheartedly.&quot;We are calling for a more coordinated approach to make sure everyone knows where and how to get help.He said: &quot;I urge as many businesses, individuals and organisations as possible to donate and help people provide food.&quot;It's shameful in this day and age that Glasgow has 50 food banks but they are here and we have to do everything we can to support them.&quot;No help is too little - we have to do as much as possible.&quot;It's just going to get worse if we have a cold winter.&quot;A Sense of Freedom will be shown at Oran Mor on October 26 and doors open at 7pm.Tickets are &pound;15. They are available from behind the bar. For information visit Spirt Aid's Facebook page.rachel.loxton@ eveningtimes.co.uk
