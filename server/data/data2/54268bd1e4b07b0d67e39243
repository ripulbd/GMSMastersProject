The charity Glasgow's Needy has said it expects thousands of bags of groceries to be donated.
An informal event last week was inspired by a speech given by one of the charity's founders, Andrew Carnegie.
He and co-founder Darren Carnegie intend to thank those making donations by staging a concert in the square, with singers and dancers.
