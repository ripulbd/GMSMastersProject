Friendly bus driver learns Polish so he can speak to his passengers - Daily Record AN ENTERPRISING bus driver is in the front seat for an award after learning Polish phrases to help confused passengers.
 Stephen Reed, 49, drives coaches on the Stagecoach X77 route between Ayr  and Glasgow. 
He picks up groups of Poles at Prestwick airport and has noticed they often only have &pound;50 notes, straight from the cash machine.
So, Stephen has picked up some Polish and now chats to them in their native tongue.
Stephen, originally from Yorkshire, said: “I often trundle up the road and get 30 Polish folk just off their flight, all with &pound;50 notes.
“There’s no way I can give 30 people that amount of change so I bought a ‘Get By in Polish’ phrase book and learned the lingo.
“They come across a black lad in Scotland who speaks Polish – you should see their faces. They say to their mates, ‘He speaks Polish, I can’t believe it’.
“Sometimes people fall asleep on the way to the airport so I wake them up in Polish.”
Stephen has been nominated for the Top National Bus Driver prize at the 2014 UK Bus Awards in London next month.
Stagecoach marketing boss Emma McNae said: “Stephen is an excellent example of a customer-focused driver. He’s a hard-working individual who understands that first impressions count.
“By learning Polish, he has gone above and beyond to ensure customers get a warm welcome.”
