Two taken to hospital after Dennistoun flat blaze TWO people were taken to hospital after a blaze at a block of flats in Glasgow's East End.The fire, which is thought to have been accidental, broke out in the bedroom of a first-floor flat in Dennistoun's Onslow Drive at 10.25am yesterday.The couple were assessed by ambulance teams and taken to the city's royal infirmary for check-ups.Fire service watch manager Eddie Kenna said they had advised people in the flats above the fire to stay inside.He said: &quot;Our crews successfully contained the fire before it could spread - but it can obviously be extre-mely frightening for someone to be in a flat and know their means of exit is blocked by toxic smoke.&quot;Our message is fire can happen anywhere and early warning is crucial. Working smoke alarms give people time to get out.&quot;
