Joint liquidators make 19 of the 30 staff redundant upon appointment, with 11 retained to facilitate sale process Joint liquidators make 19 of the 30 staff redundant upon appointment, with 11 retained to facilitate sale process - Daily Record The Glasgow-based company behind game and messaging content creator WeeWorld has entered provision liquidation with the loss of 19 jobs.
A total of 30 staff were employed at WeeWorld’s offices in Blythswood Square in Glasgow, and 19 were made redundant with immediate effect on the appointment of administrators.
Tom MacLennan and Iain Fraser of FRP Advisory have been appointed as joint provisional liquidators to WeeWorld and are now seeking a purchaser for the business and assets, and 11 staff have been retained to facilitate the sale process.
The company is reported to have run into cashflow difficulties.
In most recent accounts for the 2013 year to March 31, WeeWorld Ltd reported turnover had fallen 26 per cent to &pound;2.61 million while administrative expenses rose more than seven per cent to &pound;3.57 million.
The company had reported pre-tax losses of &pound;1.62 million for the 2013 year, with losses having increased on the &pound;855,894 pre-tax loss booked for the 2012 year.
The company's auditors had also included an 'emphasis of matter' in the 2013 accounts voicing concerns about the company's ability to continue trading as a going concern.
The auditors noted: “The company incurred a net loss of &pound;1,447,981 during the year ended March 31, 2013 and, at that date, the company's liabilities exceeded its total assets by &pound;16,449.592.
“The net current assets of the company at the year end were &pound;44,577.
“These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.”
A note in the 2013 accounts from the company states WeeWorld Ltd is a 100 per cent wholly-owned subsidiary of WeeWorld Inc, “and relies on its parent to support its ongoing operations”.
WeeWorld Inc is incorporated in Delaware in the United States.
The statement adds the directors had expected WeeWorld Group to “become consistently cash positive during the first quarter of 2014 and thereafter” and would not require further external funding to support its operations.
FRP Advisory's Tom MacLennan said: “WeeWorld is an entertainment business with a large and loyal following in the youth market.
“This is an outstanding opportunity to acquire a unique brand with a wealth of specialist intellectual property that has benefited from substantial investment.
“The IP [intellectual property] brand and assets of WeeWorld will be of interest to the games and apps sector, or to a business looking to acquire a unique portfolio of knowledge and expertise in the entertainment market.
“We would urge interested parties to make contact with us as soon as possible.”
WeeWorld was launched in 2006 and to date “60 million WeeMees” user avatars created to join the wider WeeWorld game, as well as “millions of apps” downloaded from www.weeworld.com.
