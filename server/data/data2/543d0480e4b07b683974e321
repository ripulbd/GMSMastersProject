Call for NHS staff to fight for patient care STAFF at a crisis-hit Glasgow hospital are being urged to "band together" to prevent patients being left on trolleys for hours waiting for beds.Scotland Patients Association insisted they must demand action after the Evening Times revealed on Friday how A&amp;E patients at Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary were left on gurneys in cold corridors for up to 17 hours while staff battled for beds.The patients' group executive director Dr Jean Turner called on them to join forces &quot;like the staff at Aberdeen's A&amp;E&quot; who won more than &pound;2million for staff recruitment after warning patient safety was at risk.She said: &quot;Staff should band together like they did in A&amp;E in Aberdeen and all say this is not safe practice and get the best outcome for patients.&quot;If they know that it is endangering their wellbeing they have to stand up and be counted.&quot;Dr Turner said staff should all get together -for safety in numbers -and come clean about what is going on.She added: &quot;Patients need to know that staff have their best interests at heart.&quot;On Friday, we revealed how Victoria Hospital's A&amp;E was in &quot;meltdown&quot; after patients, including OAPs, were left for up to 17 hours on trolleys because of a bed shortage.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde apologised to patients and blamed the chaos on &quot;highly unusual surge&quot; in admissions.Some staff claimed the hospital is being run down in preparation for the opening of the new South Glasgow University Hospital.However a spokes-woman for NHSGGC said: &quot;It is inaccurate to suggest that the Victoria Infirmary is being run down. Every single bed at the Victoria Infirmary is fully operational and fully staffed and we are committed to ensuring that the hospital continues to provide safe and sustainable services.&quot;
