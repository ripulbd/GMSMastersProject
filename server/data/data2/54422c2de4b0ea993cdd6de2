New home hell as car wedged on driveway A HEAD teacher has been driven to the brink of distraction after work on her £300,000 new home trapped her car in the driveway.Sharon Downie's BMW became wedged on the top of the double driveway of her four-bedroom home at the Keepers Gate development, on the site of the former Glasgow Zoo.As she pulled in, she heard the driveway scrape the underside of the car, wedging it on top of the part where it met the pavement, and stopped immediately.The 38-year-old, of Calderpark Gardens, Baillieston, is angry because she alerted Miller Homes to the problem three times after noticing the driveway's drop was too steep for her car during previous visits.Sharon said: &quot;For the money you are paying for a new house, you don't expect this. It's unbelievable. I contacted the sales team three weeks ago, when the driveway was built. I told them about it three times. It is so frustrating.&quot;Sharon had been looking forward to moving into the new house, which she bought after seeing the plot last year. She has watched her dream home go up since January, when work began on the newest part of the housing development.Sharon, who used to live in Swinton, said she wanted to move to Keepers Gate because it was family friendly and &quot;a nice estate&quot;.Her niece Sharon Bonner, 23, and daughter Lauren Henderson, 7, are moving in with her.Sharon said Miller Homes had asked her to move the car when she called them on the day she moved in, last Friday, but she refused, saying she wanted BMW to come out and lift the car, preventing any further damage.She said: &quot;They want it moved. It doesn't look good. I bought a house specifically with two garages and I can't put my car in either.&quot;The head teacher of Dean&shy;park Nursery, Shawlands, said the driveway was not the only complaint with her home.It was painted cream, instead of the white she asked for, skirting boards she asked to be left off so she could put tiling down had been put up, and the road, pavement and flower beds were unfinished.She said: &quot;It has been such a disappointment. Lauren was excited about moving in and it has spoiled it for her.&quot;She said she phoned Neil Gaffney, Miller Homes sales director, and he had apologised but could not give a timescale for the repair.Miller Homes described it as &quot;an isolated incident.&quot;A spokeswoman said: &quot;Our driveways are constructed to a standard design specifi&shy;cation approved by the local authority and the National House-Building Council and deemed suitable for the majority of vehicles.&quot;We are working with our customer to bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion.&quot;victoria.brenan@ eveningtimes.co.uk
