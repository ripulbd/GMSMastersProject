Pop-up food bank will provide a square meal A temporary food bank will 'pop up' in George Square today, next to where anti-poverty campaigner Darren Carnegie is camping out.As the Evening Times reported on Thursday, Darren, 25, has pitched camp outside the City Chambers to raise awareness of the growing problem of poverty in Glasgow.With the help of his dad, Andrew, 45, the pair, who live in Tollcross, are inviting people who need support to come to the square from noon until 3pm to collect free food.The father and son, who have been collecting groceries for their food bank, Glasgow's Needy, will also offer advice to help struggling families by signposting them to support agencies.Darren said: &quot;We will have bags of food prepared and we will give them out to anyone who needs them.&quot;We will also help people out with advice in any way we can.&quot;People are in poverty for so many different reasons, we would never stigmatise anyone.&quot;Darren set up camp on Wednesday and plans to stay in the square for a week.He has decorated the area with a peace flag and posters proclaiming: 'End poverty now!'.Since beginning his one-man protest, Darren said he had been &quot;overwhelmed&quot; with the support he has received from city residents, who have helped to keep him warm by providing hats and extra pairs of socks.Some people have even bought him hot drinks and stayed in the square speaking with him until the early hours.Darren said: &quot;I didn't realise how hard it was going to be. The cold is unbelievable, it's freezing.&quot;But I just have to remember that some people in Glasgow are dealing with this week after week, month after month, and I'm only doing this for a week.&quot;To be honest, I thought I'd be bored and have long periods of time on my own, but I'm hardly ever alone.&quot;Most of the time there's 10 or 15 people gathered around me.&quot;Darren said the aim of his occupation is to get people talking about poverty. His will to continue was strengthened this week by statistics which revealed a third of children in Glasgow are living below the breadline.rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk
