He was taken by ambulance to the Victoria Infirmary where he died a short time later. His relatives are aware.
Constable Gavin Irvine, of the Glasgow road policing unit, said: “A number of people stopped to try and help Mr Gilmour and we have spoken to them about what happened, however, we are still keen to speak to anyone else who witnessed the crash.
“This is quite a busy road and at this time there would have been a number of people about.”
The road was closed for around seven hours and reopened at around 2.30am.
