A SCOTTISH father of three who claimed he wanted to join  Islamic State has been jailed for 16 months.

Abdul Hafes, 35, posted on Twitter he “hates Shia and Kurds” and said they should die.
He said he would “love to join Isis in Iraq”, referring to the group by an alternate name, and asked for information to be  e-mailed to him. The posts were spotted by a member of the public and reported to police.
Hafes, from Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, previously pleaded guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to intending to stir up hatred on religious grounds and making racist remarks and inquiring about joining Isis. 
Earlier, the court was told the comments were spotted on  21 June this year and reported to police when the tweets became more “abusive and aggressive”.
The first tweet spotted was “join us in Iraq” but later became violent and hate-filled. Hafes wrote “dirty sum bastards Shia low life scum bastards”. He also wrote “I f****** hate Shia and Kurds you people should die”.
A search warrant for Hafes’ house was granted and various items seized including phones, laptops and iPads.
While being interviewed by police, Hafes initially made no comment, although he then said his actions were because of alcohol and he could not remember posting the tweets.
