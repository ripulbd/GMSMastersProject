City model swaps bright lights to be cool with cats A FORMER model has quit London's catwalk to cater for the whims of Glasgow's pampered pusses.Emily Devine was snapped up by Models 1, which has Yasmin le Bon and Linda Evangelista on its books, after shooting up to 6ft at the age of 14.Her striking elfin looks caught the attention of legendary photographer David Bailey and one of her first modelling jobs was for cult magazine The Face.But she gave up the glitz and glamour of London life to set up a pet sitting business - Candyfloss Cats - in Glasgow.She now caters for more than 1000 cats, with her duties extending to opening Christmas presents from devoted owners.Emily, who lives in Old Drumchapel, said: &quot;People used to always say to me at school, you should model but I just wanted to be like all my friends, who were all 5ft something.&quot;I had modelled in Glasgow, wee bits and pieces and then, when I was 23, I went to Gig on the Green and this woman was really staring at me.&quot;She asked if I had modelled in London and asked if I wanted to come down, saying she thought I would be really good for her agency.&quot;Emily, 38, did some test shots in London and was quickly snapped up by Models 1.She said: &quot;I was down there Monday to Friday and back up in Glasgow at weekends. It was quite a whirlwind. I got a request to do a job that was nude. I wasn't sure, then they told me it was for David Bailey's new book.&quot;I was warned he might be difficult, but he was very nice. He just called me 'Scotland'. I think Glaswegian people have the banter gene. He took two pictures and that was it.&quot;Emily's shot featured in a book by Bailey and celebrity photographer Rankin, alongside images of Jerry Hall and Jodie Kidd.Another career highlights included being chosen to model for Scottish designer Christopher Kane's first London shows.She also enjoyed a personal meeting with US Vogue editor Anna Wintour.It was while she was working out in the gym that Emily spotted an advert for a dog walker, which led to her opening up her own catsitting business in Glasgow. She now has four staff and a client base of around 650 owners and more than 1000 cats.Emily said: &quot;I know every one of them... I won't know the owner but if you show me a picture, I'll know the cat.&quot;caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
