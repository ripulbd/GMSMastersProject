THE special life sized statue - which was signed by Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy - will take pride of place at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow. Commonwealth Games mascot Clyde has found a new job... cheering up Scotland’s sick kids - Daily Record COMMONWEALTH Games mascot Clyde has been given a new lease of life cheering up Scotland’s sick kids.
The special life sized statue - which was signed by Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy - will take pride of place at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow.
Clyde - dressed in the famous red and grey Games uniform - was seen by the Queen and more than 50,000 staff and volunteers when he was the welcoming face at the entrance to the Glasgow 2014 accreditation centre at the Kelvin Hall.
Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg said: “Clyde was the cheeky, cheery face of Glasgow 2014 created by a child for children and adults alike. I am thrilled that he will continue to bring a smile to the faces of Glasgow’s children in need for years to come.”
Schoolgirl Beth Gilmour - a 14-year-old from Lenzie - who designed Commonwealth mascot Clyde, has loved the reaction her colourful creation has received from Games fans.
She said it was “amazing” to see how successful it has been. Beth Gilmour was just 12 when she sketched the green thistle-man with purple hair who has proved a hit with Games fans.
There were 25 statues of the character dotted around Glasgow, forming the Clyde Trail, which has proved popular with photo-hunting tourists.
