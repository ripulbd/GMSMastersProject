Our audience of music fans play a key part in&nbsp;everything that we do and it’s really important to us that the people of Glasgow have as many opportunities as possible to be part of the MTV experience.&nbsp; We’ve got a stellar line-up that includes a whole host of club nights and incredible live music in addition to the show itself at The SSE Hydro and we can guarantee a very special MTV buzz throughout the city during the week of&nbsp;November&nbsp;3&nbsp;– and a serious party!”
