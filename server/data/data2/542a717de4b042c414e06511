A DISABLED boy's dreams will come true thanks to a building firm. Builder steps in to answer tumour boy's bedroom plea A DISABLED boy's dreams will come true thanks to a building firm.Lambert Contracts Ltd offered to help 10-year-old Mark Gallagher, from Crookston, Glasgow, after his family started a fundraising appeal to build him a new bedroom.As earlier reported in the Evening Times, Mark developed a brain tumour four years ago and has undergone almost 30 operations to save his life. But the intensive treatment has left him with mobility problems and he is no longer able to reach his upstairs bedroom.Since then he has been sleeping on a bed in the living room and has to have bed baths because he cannot use the upstairs shower.His parents, Michelle and Chris, were trying to raise &pound;10,000 to transform their unsused garage into a bedroom and wet room when they were contacted by the building firm.They were overjoyed Gary Clark, director of Lambert Contracts Ltd, Paisley, called offering to do the work free.Mr Clark said: &quot;My wife drew my attention to the story in the Evening Times. When I read it and looked at where Mark lived, I knew we could help him.&quot;We are planning to run a cable in and sort the drainage while we wait for the architects' drawings.&quot;The family told me Mark's life is on hold at the moment.&quot;He will be able to sleep better once we have finished and with the wet room and shower in the back I am hoping it will improve the quality of his life as well.&quot;I am sure he will be delighted when it is finished.&quot;Work will start next month and it is hoped it will be completed by Christmas.Michelle said: &quot;It will make such a difference to him. Mark was delighted when we told him.&quot;He will be able to bring his friends in to play - he won't have to take them into the living room and sit with all of us. It will also give him more freedom.&quot;It seemed unbelievable someone would offer to help us like that.&quot;The &pound;4700 we have raised so far will be used to treat Mark.&quot;The cash will furnish Mark's new room, and his parents are hoping to take him on holiday for a week.Michelle said: &quot;Mark's not allowed to fly so wherever we go we need to be close to a hospital.&quot;hannah.rodger@ eveningtimes.co.uk
