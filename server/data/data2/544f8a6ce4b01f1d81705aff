THE 32-year-old pulled out of the European Open at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Saturday after being floored by a virus but travelled to Astana yesterday. Judo: Commonwealth Games star Louise Renicks receives all-clear to compete in Kazakhstan - Daily Record JUDO star Louise Renicks has vowed to bounce back from her Glasgow disappointment in Kazakhstan this week.
The 32-year-old pulled out of the European Open at the Emirates Arena after being floored by a virus.
Renicks yesterday received the green light from medics and travelled east for big competitions in the Kazakh capital city of Astana and Uzbekistan.
And the Commonwealth Games gold medallist hopes to make her mark in events dubbed ‘mini-Olympics’.
“I was bitterly disappointed at not being able to compete on Saturday but you have to move on,” said Renicks who fights in the -52kg division.
“I’ve now got to focus on the Grand Prix in Kazakhstan and Grand Slam competition in Uzbekistan.
“These are very important events as there are a lot of points on offer – just winning a fight gets you points.
“All the fighters will be Olympians so you are up against some of the best fighters in the world.
“I like going to these events. It’s very professional from the minute you arrive and you can focus on your preparation.”
