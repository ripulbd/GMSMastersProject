Deal to buy Scottish firm to lead to 12 extra staff New jobs in pipeline after stem cell takeover deal - Daily Record Scottish life sciences company Pharmacells today said it was planning to accelerate stem cell therapy trials and create 12 jobs following its acquisition by London-based Precious Cells.
The additional jobs will be created at its BioCity base at Newhouse near Glasgow.
Pharmacells was the first company to take a tenancy in the life sciences hub in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New jobs will also be created in West London, where Precious Cells currently employs 25 staff based on the Brunel Science Park.
Pharmacells’ patented technology enables stem cells to be collected from adult blood to allow an individual’s own cells to be used in treatment. As a result, treatment using stem cells is expected to be far more effective as it lowers the risk of a body rejecting the cells.
Athol Haas, chief executive and co-founder of Pharmacells&nbsp; said: “Partnering with Precious Cells, one of the world’s leading stem cell consumer technology platform service providers,&nbsp; with its depth of resource and international reach will considerably enhance our efforts to market the technology in the UK and globally.”
