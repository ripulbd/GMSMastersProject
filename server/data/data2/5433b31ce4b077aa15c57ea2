Glasgow City have won their eighth Scottish Women's Premier League title in succession with three games of the campaign still to play. Glasgow City secure their eighth successive SWPL title  Glasgow City have won their eighth Scottish Women's Premier League title in succession with three games of the campaign still to play. 
 A 2-0 win for Spartans over Rangers means Glasgow are 12 points clear and now cannot be caught in the title race. 
 City's only league defeat - their first in almost six years - came against Spartans in September. 
 &quot;To win one title is difficult, to win eight in a row is truly historic,&quot; Glasgow boss Eddie Wolecki Black said. 
 City have already secured the League Cup this term, are in the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup and face Polish Champions Medyk Konin in the last 32 of the Champions League. 
 And Black believes his side's achievements are all the more impressive given the fact they have had to deal with a series of injuries to key players this term. 
 &quot;We did not win this title with 11 players, we won this with many people making vital contributions,&quot; he added. 
 &quot;There is no doubt that it has been a difficult season but when you add the League title to the League Cup then it is a very good season. 
 &quot;With such a heavy schedule there is barely time to celebrate but it does not stop me from acknowledging a remarkable achievement.&quot;
