DRIVERS could be forced to pay to park outside their own homes when a new high-rise hospital opens. Pay-to-park plan for car owners in Govan to beat flood of hospital drivers DRIVERS could be forced to pay to park outside their own homes when a new high-rise hospital opens.The council is considering a West End-style controlled parking scheme for the Govan area which is expected to cost each householder &pound;50 a year.The new &pound;842million South Glasgow Hospital campus will employ more than 10,000 staff and many more patients and visitors will travel to and from the building every day.But fewer than 3000 parking spaces will be provided when the 24-hour facility opens its doors next year.A council insider said: &quot;It's going to be chaos unless there is some kind of permit system. It will affect half of Govan. It'll be massive.&quot;There will be huge costs to set it up and then enforce it so it could mean residents paying up to &pound;50 a year for each space.&quot;We can't just build more car parks for staff and patients because it's supply and demand - it will only encourage more people to use cars.&quot;The Evening Times understands a controlled parking zone (CPZ) is being planned.High-level talks have taken place between council and NHS bosses in recent weeks.They hope to introduce a scheme which would see bays painted on residential streets.But the parking spaces will not be exclusive to homeowners with permits - they will also be available to motorists who put money in meters.Glasgow City Council's roads spokesman, Councillor Alistair Watson, insisted those who live in Govan would get priority.He said: &quot;On-street parking controls in the nearby neighbourhoods would dissuade all-day commuter parking during the working week and would give residents parking priority.&quot;Without the sustainable transport improvements and the on-street parking controls, indiscriminate parking and difficulties for residents to find an available parking space near their property are likely to occur.&quot;Consultation events are to be held at Elder Park library later this month for residents to have their say on designs which are said to be &quot;at a preliminary stage.&quot;Govan councillor James Adams said: &quot;I'd encourage residents to come along to the information days and help us shape the strategy for protecting their ability to park outside their homes.&quot;These measures are designed to dissuade the use of private cars, particularly, by commuters, through providing a high-quality and more sustainable mode of transport as an attractive alternative.&quot;These issues are commonplace in other areas of the city and the objective of the controls is intended to ensure that commuter parking does not become problematic for the local residents.&quot;The events at Elder Park library will be held on October 23 and 24 between 10am and 5pm and on October 25 between 10am and 3pm.The new multi-storey hospital at the current Southern General campus will have more than 1400 beds and employ upwards of 10,000 workers.Patients, facilities and staff will be transferred to the building from the Southern General, the Victoria Infirmary, the Western and Yorkhill Children's Hospital.Some services from other hospitals, including the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, will also move to Govan.There will be only 2800 parking spaces when it opens because the top tier of a car park will still be under construction. The remaining 700 bays will be available in 2016.As part of the planning process, a Transport Assessment was undertaken and measures aimed at avoiding roads chaos were identified.These include improved public transport services to and from the hospital as well as upgraded walking and cycling routes.peter.swindon@eveningtimes.co.uk
