CHARLIE Glass, 68, and cousin Tommy Glass, 80, are bot fighting the effects of working with the insulation and fire-proofing material. Family claim they are being killed off by asbestos after two cousins die following exposure to deadly powder - Daily Record A FAMILY claim they are being killed off by deadly asbestos after two cousins died following exposure to the powder.
Two other members of the family are also fighting the effects of working with the insulation and fire-proofing material.
Charlie Glass, 68, and cousin Tommy Glass, 80, are both fighting for their lives. Charlie has already lost his brother Tommy at the age of 63 and his cousin George, also Glass, aged 80, to mesothelioma.
Joiner Tommy died in 2011. He had helped build the operating theatre at Glasgow’s Victoria Infirmary with asbestos panels.
George was a plasterer who worked for Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Corporation. Retired electrician Charlie and cousin Tommy struggle to breathe because of pleural plaques linked to asbestos exposure.
Charlie, from Bridgeton, Glasgow, said: “As a family, we’re being killed off one by one. We spent years working hard to bring up families while placing trust in our employers and the Government to protect us.
“The first warnings about asbestos were given out in 1906 in a parliamentary report but employers didn’t protect workers or tell them about the dangers.
“Tragically, our story is one which affects hundreds across the country.”
Law firm Irwin Mitchell have settled thousands of cases for asbestos victims.
The firm’s major injuries specialist Laura McCallum said: “We are acting for the family but no amount of money can make up for the illness and death.”
