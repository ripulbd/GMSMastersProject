The figure was revealed by Police Scotland Chief Constable Sir Stephen House at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority on Thursday.
He said officers at the gathering on 19 September faced a &quot;difficult event&quot;. 
There were scenes of disorder when a group who appeared to be pro-Union supporters arrived and began to taunt Yes campaigners who had gathered there. 
The arrests were for various offences including disorder, breach of the peace and vandalism.
Supporters of independence had been gathering in George Square in the final days of the campaign and on the day of the result.
Trouble flared when a number of people draped in union flags arrived in the area. They sang Rule Britannia and a flare was let off.
Police - some mounted on horses - moved in to separate the rival groups.
