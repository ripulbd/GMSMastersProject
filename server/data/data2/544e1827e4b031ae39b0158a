Sarwar 'keeps options open' on leadership ANAS Sarwar has said he is keeping his options open as Scottish Labour prepare to elect a new leader.The Glasgow Central MP is interim leader of the party in Scotland following the resignation of Johann Lamont and considered one of the favourites if he decides to run.Mr Sarwar said: &quot;It is right that people reflect on it. I want to keep that option open and think it through. My responsibility is to make sure we have a quick process and keep the Labour family together.&quot;He said he did not recognise the criticisms made by Ms Lamont as she resigned citing interference from London Labour management.Ms Lamont said her position was untenable when the Scottish Labour general secretary, Ian Price, was &quot;removed&quot; by London without her being consulted.Mr Sarwar said Mr Price &quot;resigned&quot; and said the UK Labour Party &quot;came together to make sure we ran an effective campaign&quot; during the referendum.Mr Sarwar has been Deputy Leader since being elected with Ms Lamont in 2011.He spent much of the referendum campaign touring the country in his indyref express 'battle bus' as well as taking part in TV debates with Nicola Sturgeon.He said the priority was to elect &quot;a new leader with new energy and new ideas to take the party forward.&quot;His main rival for the post is expected to be East Renfrewshire MP Jim Murphy, should he decide to stand. Douglas Alexander MP and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown have also been mentioned as possible contenders.One senior Scottish MP to rule herself out is Shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran. A spokesman said the Glasgow East MP will not be standing, instead she is concentrating on the general election next year.MSPs considered to be possible contenders include Glasgow MP Drew Smith, Lothians MSP Kezia Dugdale and health spokesman Neil Findlay.Party officials met in Glasgow yesterday to set out the process and timescale for the election.Some within the party said there must be greater power for the Scottish leader and party.Glasgow Labour Councillor Jonathan Findlay&nbsp; said: &quot;The defining issue of the leadership contest will now be the the freedom of Scottish Labour to set its own policies and priorities without Westminster interference.&quot;
