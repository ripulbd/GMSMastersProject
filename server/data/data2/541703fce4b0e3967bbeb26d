The rest of the jobs will be filled by external recruitment. 
Glasgow-based Clyde Marine Recruitment has been tasked with finding a new managing director, several senior managers and a naval architect. 
The search will be led by Marine's specialist agency, Red the Consultancy.
Gavin McCallum, chief operations officer at Clyde Blowers Capital, said: &quot;We have moved quickly to secure the future of this shipyard by employing some of the former workers.
&quot;With the help of expert and specialist recruiters who have a truly global reach, we will put in place a team that will ensure Ferguson Marine Engineering has a very bright future. 
&quot;This is a new beginning for one of the most famous Scottish shipyards that will have a hugely positive impact on the economy of the local area and along the banks of the River Clyde up into Glasgow. 
&quot;And this is only the beginning. By hiring world class management, we are confident this yard will soon be competing on the global stage and accessing new markets.&quot;
