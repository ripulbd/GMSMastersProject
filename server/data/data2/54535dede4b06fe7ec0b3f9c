FUNDING to a lifeline service for people with mental illness is planned to be axed by the council. Fears for lifeline service facing a 40% cut in cash FUNDING to a lifeline service for people with mental illness is planned to be axed by the council.The Glasgow Association of Mental Health (GAMH), which helps more than 1000 city residents each week, is expected to lose 40% of its cash from next year.Some of Glasgow's most vulnerable residents are helped by the charity, including those with paranoia, schizophrenia, depression and personality disorders.Doctors, community addiction services, hospitals, housing associations and city crisis teams all refer clients to the service, which helps them cope with day-to-day life through socialisation, and workshops.Currently the impact of the cuts on GAMH, which has 120 staff, is unknown but a previous 8% cut in funding resulted in 27 job losses at the organisation.GAMH, based in Turnbull Street, is understood to be the first of several charities due to face funding cuts by the social work department, with others finding out the plans in next few days.Unison union officer Deborah Dyer warned service users will &quot;go into melt down&quot; if the cuts by Glasgow City Council go ahead.She said: &quot;People will end up in acute beds, in police cells; they will end up on the street.&quot;Just closing a charity down, which is effectively what they are doing, is irresponsible. The council is demanding they provide a city-wide service and are making cuts at 40%.&quot;GAMH has realistically said it can't offer a city-wide service and warned them it would put the whole viability of the charity at risk.&quot;The council is hoping this will just disappear quietly to hide the fact they are in crisis with their budget. This isn't how you treat people.&quot;The leader of the council is advocating that he will look after the health and mental wellbeing of the people of Glasgow - he's not doing that.&quot;I don't believe there has been proper consultation as closing a charity like this will end up costing the city money.&quot;One member of staff said he didn't know what would happen to the thousands of Glaswegians who are helped by GAMH, and admitted the charity would probably have to close if the 40% cuts went ahead.A spokesman for the council said: &quot;The majority of service users who use GAMH are not known to social work, but those who are will continue to be supported by social work services.&quot;The council's budget for the next financial year has still to be agreed and so decisions on individual funding awards have still to be taken.&quot;However, even after years of huge pressure on the council's budget, it has been widely anticipated that further savings will be required.&quot;Where appropriate we have been working with providers to inform them of the reality of the public finances so they can plan accordingly.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk
