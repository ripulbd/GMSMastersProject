Salmond backs rescued yard to lead the way A SHIPYARD which was rescued from closure is pointing the way to Scotland's industrial future, the First Minister has said.The Ferguson yard in Port Glasgow went into administration in August but was taken over by Clyde Blowers Capital last month.Now operating as Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL), it has already won a &pound;12.3 million contract to build a new hybrid ferry for CalMac.The Scottish Government investment, being taken forward by Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL), will secure jobs for about 80 people at the shipyard.Visiting the Clyde yard yesterday, Alex Salmond said he believes it is going to be one of the country's great success stories.He said: &quot;This idea that shipbuilding is a dying industry, something of the industrial past, that's only if you don't modernise and you don't go into the marketplace.&quot;There's a huge market for top quality design, not just in Scotland, but across Europe .The yard, which dates back to 1902, went into administration after experiencing &quot;significant cash-flow pressure&quot; with the loss of 70 posts.But after being acquired by Clyde Blowers Capital, founded by businessman Jim McColl, a number of those who were sacked have been rehired.
