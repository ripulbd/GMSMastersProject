A builder is facing jail for attempting to murder a man with a machete over a disputed unpaid bill of Â£50. Cash row builder Scott Dominick faces jail over murder bid A builder is facing jail for attempting to murder a man with a machete over a disputed unpaid bill of &pound;50.
Scott Dominick slashed Andrew Palmer in Colliers pub, Johnstone, Renfrewshire, on 2 March this year.
The dispute arose because 50-year-old Dominick had carried out more work than was agreed on a patio at Mr Palmer's estranged wife's house in Linwood. 
At the High Court in Glasgow, sentence on Dominick was deferred and he was remanded in custody.
The court heard that Mr Palmer arranged through another man, Iain Sproule, for Dominick to carry out work at his wife's house in February. 
More expensive work was done than was originally agreed and Dominick wanted payment for that. 
Mr Palmer said his wife gave him an extra &pound;50, but there was another &pound;50 outstanding. 
Dominick was never told he was not going to get paid. 
It was alleged that the builder had overheard Mr Palmer making an insulting remark about him and believed he was being taken advantage of.
On 2 March when Mr Palmer and his friend Martin Docherty were drinking in Colliers pub, Dominick armed himself with a machete from his house. 
He went to the pub with the weapon to scare Mr Palmer and questioned him about the money. 
Dominick initially had the machete tucked into his jacket then presented the weapon at Mr Palmer and held it under his chin. 
Following an exchange he slashed Mr Palmer before a struggle involving both men and two others followed,
The police were called and Dominick was taken away in handcuffs. He later told the officers: &quot;I know what I did, I will slash your throats too.&quot;
