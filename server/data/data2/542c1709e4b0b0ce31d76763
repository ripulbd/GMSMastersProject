New look Queen Street station plans revealed Updated plans for the £104 million transformation of Queen Street station have been unveiled.Additional cycle stands and widened stairs at the station's George Square entrance are among the changes unveiled by Network Rail following an initial public consultation.Artist impressions reveal what the revamped station will look like inside for the first time.The main access ramp will now be located insidethe&nbsp; building rather than outside. The stairs at the entrance onto George Square will also be wider than they were in the original plans following public feedback, and access to the low level at the east side will be enhanced by moving the lifts closer to the stairs.The footbridge running east-west at the mezzanine level across the centre of the station has been removed and ticket gate lanes have been changed to enhance concourse space and improve access to the low level station.Network Rail are also working with access consultants and representatives to maximise provisions for disabled access and facilities including parking, drop-off entrances/exits and toilets.The project, which is scheduled to run from 2015 until 2019, will replace the current 1970s entrance and the hotel extension above with a modern glass facade.As previously revealed, platforms will also be extended and the east side of the building will be redeveloped as part of the adjacent Buchanan Galleries extension to create passenger facilities over two levels.Designers want to turn the station, which is Scotland's third busiest and the 'gateway to the Highlands', into a landmark building on the corner of George Square.A second and final consultation phase has been launched and will run until December 22.
