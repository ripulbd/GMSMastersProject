Employers GMB have agreed to cover George Ferrier’s statutory sick pay - but not his wages. Mr Ferrier, 56, was set upon by thieves carrying baseball bats and axes as he tried to prevent their escape from the upmarket retail district off Buchanan Street on September 14.
The security guard sustained multiple injuries to his legs from being struck by a baseball bat as he guided staff to safety. Mr Ferrier was forced to eventually let the robbers pass after they ran at him with axes. 
Mr Ferrier told the Daily Record that he was “disappointed” with the way his employers had treated him, accusing them of not caring about his health and well-being after the attack. 
After being told to rest for two weeks by his doctor, Mr Ferrier discovered that GMB would only pay him &pound;87.55 a week - a sum only paid out once an employee has been off for four days in a row. 
He said: “I’ve had a lot of really nice feedback but the work has been keen to get me back as quickly as possible. If they think I should be getting just sick pay after what’s happened, that’s up to them - but it doesn’t seem right to me. I’m disappointed in them.”
