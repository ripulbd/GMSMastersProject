I will work tirelessly to protect and improve it.&quot;The Glasgow Southside MSP said all Scots must face up to the opportunities which lie ahead.She said: &quot;Our differing views on independence doesn't mean we don't share many other aspirations for our country. We do. Aspirations of a healthy economy, strong public services, and a flourishing democracy.&quot;And that is why, for each and every day that I hold office as First Minister, I will govern this country to the very best of my ability - and I will do so for all of Scotland.&quot;stewart.paterson@eveningtimes.co.uk
