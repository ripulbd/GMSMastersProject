 Celtic will make a late decision on the fitness of Kris Commons for their Europa League match against Romania's Astra Giurgiu on Thursday. 
 The midfielder missed Saturday's 5-0 win at Ross County but Emilio Izaguirre has recovered from an injury he sustained in that match and is fit. 
 Lukasz Zaluska is in Celtic's squad despite being injured in a street attack at the weekend. 
 Striker Sadat Bukari misses out for the Romanians. 
 Nigerian forward Kehinde Fatai and Ghanaian midfielder Seidu Yahaya trained with Astra on Wednesday night despite arriving late in Scotland due to visa problems. 
 Celtic striker John Guidetti is ineligible and winger James Forrest is not ready for first-team action following a hamstring injury. 
  Celtic defender Jason Denayer:  &quot;I think they will be like a lot of teams when they come to Celtic Park, they will play on the counter attack. 
 &quot;We have to be patient and play like we play and it will come.&quot; 
  Astra defender Syam Ben Youssef:  &quot;We have nothing to lose here and we have to enjoy it. 
 &quot;It is not a bad result if we get a draw with Celtic but for me, I play first to win.&quot;
