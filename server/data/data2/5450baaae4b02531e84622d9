Royal Marines to be given the Freedom of Glasgow THE Royal Marines will be honoured with the Freedom of the City on Saturday.More than 100 will parade through Glasgow to receive the highest award the city can confer to mark their 350th anniversary.The parade will be made up of the Clyde based 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group, the band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines Scotland, veterans and Royal Marine cadets from the Glasgow area.Lord Provost Sadie Docherty will present the honour to Commandant General, Major General Martin Smith.He will accept it on behalf of the United Kingdom's entire Royal Marine Corps at a special ceremony in George Square.The elite commandos will then exercise their new freedom in a second march with swords drawn, bayonets fixed, drums beating and colours flying.Mrs Docherty and Major General Smith will take the salute.The Freedom of the City was introduced in the 1800s and this is only the third time it has been conferred on such a grand scale to military personnel. The Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment) were similarly honoured in 1948 and the Royal Highland Fusiliers in 1959.The Royal Marines will march at 10.30am from Holland Street to George Square by way of West Regent Street, Douglas Street and Nelson Mandela Place.Following the ceremony the sea soldiers will march from George Square through St Vincent Street, Renfield Street, Union Street, Argyle Street, Queen Street, Ingram Street and South Frederick Street then return to the Square.The decision to award the Freedom of the City to the Royal Marines follows a motion to the city council last year by council veterans' champion Malcolm Cunning.He said the honour would demonstrate the highest respect for the proud history of the Corps and the dedication and sacrifices it continues to make to protect the interests of the United Kingdom.Mr Cunning added: &quot;To award the Freedom of the City of Glasgow to the Royal Marines publicly acknowledges the regard in which the unit is held and will highlight the strong relationship that continues between the Royal Marines and Glasgow.&quot;The service has a permanent presence in the city through the Glasgow detachment of the Royal Marines Reserve Scotland which was raised in 1948.The Freedom celebrations will include entertainment in George Square including an offshore raiding craft which the public will be able to climb aboard. It is an eight seater vessel used to transport troops which is 30ft long and weighs 5500kg.There will also be an inflatable raiding craft, a weapons stance and an Arctic warfare display.Glasgow was the first city in the world to honour Nelson Mandela with the Freedom of the City, in 1981, nine years before he was released from prison.Comedian Billy Connelly was the last person to receive the honour from the city in 2010.vivienne.nicoll@eveningtimes.co.uk
