THOUSANDS of new construction jobs will be created as part of a £3.5billion investment to improve water services across Scotland. £3.5bn upgrade is no pipe dream THOUSANDS of new construction jobs will be created as part of a £3.5billion investment to improve water services across Scotland.Glasgow is set to benefit from the six-year Scottish Water programme, with planned projects across the city, including in the South Side and the East End.Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement yesterday at Glasgow's Clyde Place, where the utility giant is working to improve the environment and quality of water in the River Clyde.Ms Sturgeon said it was &quot;investment that really matters across the country.&quot;&quot;We need modern, fit for purpose water and sewerage infrastructure, so our economy can continue to grow and domestic consumers can get the water services they need and demand,&quot; she said.&quot;So this investment is thoroughly good news.&quot;It's also, as well as delivering fit for purpose infrastructure, supporting significant numbers of jobs along the way.&quot;And the estimate is that this &pound;3.5bn investment will support 5000 jobs - so that's an added bonus.&quot;Ms Sturgeon said she expected the publicly-owned company to deliver the programme &quot;without the need for inflation-busting charge increases.&quot;An exemption scheme for charities, to help pay for their water and sewerage services, will be extended.The Glasgow Southside MSP said the city would see &quot;significant investment&quot; to some of its &quot;Victorian&quot; infrastructure.Projects in the plan include more than &pound;100m for a waste water tunnel, to improve water quality in the Clyde and reduce the flooding risk in Mount Florida and Giffnock.More than &pound;280m will be spent to improve mains and treatments works across Scotland, with &pound;60m allocated to reduce the impact of discharges into the Clyde from the Daldowie and Dalmarnock waste water treatment works.Ms Sturgeon added: &quot;I'm here on the South Side looking at a system which is improving overflow systems to improve water quality in the Clyde but this is just part of an overall package to make sure the water infrastructure in Glasgow, some of which is of Victorian vintage, is brought up to date.&quot;Having modern, efficient water systems is vital to making sure businesses can grow and consumers get what they want and need.&quot;The plans are backed by &pound;720m of borrowing from the Scottish Government.Wearing a hard hat and safety vest, Ms Sturgeon toured of the site and met two of the apprentices who have been taken on.Courtney Mitchell, 17, from Crookston, started with the company last month.She said: &quot;I think it's really important for people to take on apprentices.&quot;I'm really enjoying working here.&quot;Ross McCorrisken, 20, from Alexandria, said: &quot;I started in 2012.&quot;You get the experience of work but you also go to college, so it's a good mix.&quot;Douglas Millican, chief executive of Scottish Water, said: &quot;We're bringing new young talented people into our building and we're in the process of employing more young graduates and more apprentices.&quot;rachel.loxton@ eveningtimes.co.uk
