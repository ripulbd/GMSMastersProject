FROM window cleaner to best-selling artist, it's fair to say Alexander Millar has had a front seat in the rollercoaster of life. Scots artist puts city in the frame FROM window cleaner to best-selling artist, it's fair to say Alexander Millar has had a front seat in the rollercoaster of life.His name is synonymous with dark, sooty paintings of old men in bunnets trudging home from a day's work in the shipyards or cycling along twilight cobbled lanes.This untrained artist only turned to drawing 10 years ago when his father was dying.&quot;I used to do sketches to make my dad feel better. I'd draw the old characters I remembered from growing up in Springside, a little &shy;village &shy;outside Kilmarnock,&quot; says &shy;Alexander, who is now based in Northumberland.&quot;When my dad died my life fell apart. The irony was that my life was down the pan but my career had started going through the roof because &shy;everybody wanted to buy my paintings. I was painting to save my sanity.&quot;A new collection of Alexander's work opens today at Scotland Street School Museum. With oil paintings and charcoal drawings of street scenes, oil rigs and Glasgow's Finnieston Crane, Working Man: The Homecoming celebrates Scotland's history and tradition, paying homage to the working men and women of Glasgow and the area's industrial heritage.&quot;I started painting solitary figures of these old men &shy;walking away: It was my dad walking away from me when he was dying,&quot; says Alexander.One of Alexander's earliest exhibitions was at Arteries Gallery in Glasgow where he sold everything two days before the preview show. Then Washington Green, one of the biggest fine art publisher in the UK, signed him up.&quot;After that it just went &shy;bananas. They gave me a one-man show in Mayfair at their flagship gallery. I remember in one of the back galleries one of my originals was hanging - to the right of it was a Monet and to the left a Degas.&quot;Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, says the new work is certain to delight visitors.&quot;Alexander's pictures beautifully detail our heritage, which is why Glasgow Museums was so keen to work with him to bring this exhibition to Scotland Street School.&quot;
