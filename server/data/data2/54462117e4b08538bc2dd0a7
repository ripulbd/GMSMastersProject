It's looking widely like gusts of up to 60mph but winds could reach around 75mph in exposed parts of Argyll and the islands.&quot;By morning, northern parts and Aberdeen will see heavy rain, with winds again widely between 55 and 60mph. It should brighten up somewhat by midday but it will remain windy throughout, with gusts of 70mph in coastal parts in the afternoon.&quot;Temperatures will struggle to reach double figures generally so it will remain cool, but the winds should gradually ease off into the night, but it is looking like a full 18 to 24-hour period of sustained winter weather.&quot;What we're seeing is the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo, which are now an extra-tropical depression.&quot;Commuters have been warned of potential disruption.Traffic Scotland said: &quot;Gales, and more locally severe gales, are expected to affect much of the country.&quot;The public should be aware of the potential for disruption to travel and possible damage to trees. Difficult driving conditions will result, perhaps exacerbated by surface water and spray.&quot;
