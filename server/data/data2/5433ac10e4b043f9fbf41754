Residents hit out at plan to charge them for parking in street FURIOUS residents attacked a plan to charge them for parking outside their own homes when a new hospital is opened.Yesterday the Evening Times exclusively revealed Glasgow City Council was considering a pay-to-park scheme in the areas around the new Southern General Hospital.The plan is expected to cost each householder &pound;50 a year for a permit to park in their street.One local resident said he would refuse to pay.Brian MacAtemey, 47, unemployed, from Linthouse said: &quot;If you pay road tax why should you have to pay extra money to park outside your own house.&quot;The &pound;842million hospital campus will provide 2800 spaces for its 10,000 staff, patients and visitors when it opens next year.Tricia Maguire, 36, a full- time mum from Drumoyne said: &quot;I've got two kids who go to the local nursery and I'm a single parent.&quot;Our money is getting cut and we are not getting as much benefits so I don't have that kind of money.&quot;My mum works and stays local - it's bad enough in her street at the moment with everyone who has cars.&quot;The cost hit a sour note with Stacey McCullagh, 32, a customer service represen-tative from Linthouse.She said: &quot;We have got two cars plus a van, that's three vehicles to our household.&quot;Is it going to be priced per car, per year, or just for one household? It could work out quite costly. If it's one space for each house and we have three, it's going to be a joke.&quot;The top floor of the car park will be completed in 2016, adding an extra 700 bays.But until then staff, patients and visitors will have access to only 2800 spaces as well as the areas around the building.Ronald McCullagh, 30, a milkman from Linthouse, said: &quot;As it is, it can be pretty tight in this street on any given day. When the bowling club is on it's even worse.&quot;With this coming in to play it will just be 100 times worse.&quot;It's just going to be chaos, I thought they were going to be having a big car park, aren't 3000 spaces going to be enough?&quot;While most residents were outraged, one local woman thought the plans could mean safer streets.Margaret Reid, 55, retired, from Linthouse said: &quot;I think it's an excellent idea.&quot;An awful lot of folk here don't have cars so it's just maybe one or two to each number, it's good and it could be safer.&quot;She also agreed that while the cost might put some people off, it wasn't too expensive.She added: &quot;&pound;50 a year wouldn't bother me because that's only &pound;1 a week. If you pay quarterly people will be more agreeable but if they say &pound;50 down payment there and then a lot of people will say it's too expensive, but really it's only a pound a week.&quot;A traffic assessment has been carried out and measures aimed at avoiding roads chaos were identified, which include improving public transport services and upgrading cycling and walking routes in the area.Consultation events are to be held at Elder Park Library on October 23 and 24 from 10am to 5pm and October 25 between 10am and 3pm.These will give residents the opportunity to raise concerns and have their say on the designs for the plans.
