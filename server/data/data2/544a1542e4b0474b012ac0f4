I leaned to pass something to my mother and I heard a man from behind ask if he could stroke the dog.&quot;I thought it was a bit strange but when you are busy you don't always think. He sat down on the seat.&quot;His girlfriend was sitting on the opposite side. They appeared out of nowhere.&quot;Very quickly he got up and said something to her and they shot off down the train.&quot;Within five minutes I realised my phone wasn't there. He had moved my rucksack off the seat. I went down the train and confronted him.
