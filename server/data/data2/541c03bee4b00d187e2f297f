HE survived cancer ... Todd beat cancer...then ran 140 miles across Sahara HE survived cancer ...and then set himself another gruelling challenge.Todd Whiteford was diagnosed with testicular cancer in January 2013 and underwent chemotherapy at the Beatson.Having come through that difficult time, the 30-year-old decided to embark on the 140-mile desert-based Marathon de Sables to raise cash for the hospital that helped save his life.And he had the full backing of best friend Ross Mackay, who completed the challenge with him.Todd said: &quot;For me, doing something to support the Beatson was a no-brainer. During my cancer scare last year, the people at the treatment centre showed professionalism and encouragement in the care they gave me.&quot;I would always champion them when it comes to fundraising - they deserve every penny.&quot;Their energy in the face of adversity was exactly what Ross and I aimed to emulate when we were out in the Sahara.&quot;Todd was just 29 when he was diagnosed and referred to the Beatson.Luckily, the disease was detected in its early stages and Todd underwent chemotherapy before being given the all-clear in May this year.He added: &quot;It really threw me. I was pretty fit, climbing Munros and playing football every week.&quot;I was very lucky with the early detection and I feel I have had a bit of a lucky escape.&quot;Throughout his illness, Todd had support from Ross, also 30, and the pair, along with other friends, completed the Caledonia Challenge.The walk, which covers 24 miles, gave them the appetite to search for the most difficult physical challenge they could find.And Marathon de Sables, which sees adrenaline junkies battle 50 degree temperatures through desert mountains, arid saltpans and rough sandstorms, was perfect.Todd, who lives in Hyndland, said: &quot;Ross and I had thought about the marathon as something to do further down the line but it just so happened that two places became available - normally there's a waiting list.&quot;Ross, who lives in London, had access to special training facilities. But to replicate the desert temperatures, he would train in layer upon layer of clothing, looking &quot;like the marshmallow man&quot;.Initially they aimed to raise &pound;2000 but have raised nearly &pound;8000 since completing the challenge for the Beatson Cancer Charity.And the race, which Todd says was &quot;incredibly tough&quot;, has brought the pair closer than ever. Todd, who met Ross at university, has now asked his friend if he will officiate at his wedding.l The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre is the UK's busiest cancer centre, and the charity aims to raise &pound;20 million over the next five years.Ross and Todd's fundraising will contribute to this target to help the 8000 new patients who are treated at the Beatson every year.David Welch, Chief Executive of the Beatson Cancer Charity said: &quot;We are extremely grateful to fundraisers Todd and Ross for their sheer determination, dedication and passion.&quot;Money raised from the challenge will further enhance our vision which is to ensure the Beatson's rightful status as one of the world's leading centres fighting cancer.&quot;catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk
