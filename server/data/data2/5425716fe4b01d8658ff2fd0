UGLY scenes followed the result of last week's referendum vote as more than 700 people gathered in Glasgow city centre. George Square violence: Number of arrests following post-referendum disorder in Glasgow reaches 20 - Daily Record  TWENTY people have now been arrested after trouble flared in Scotland's biggest city in the wake of the referendum result. 
 There were ugly scenes after hundreds of people gathered in Glasgow's George Square last Friday , with police - some mounted on horses - lining up to divide rival supporters of the union and independence. 
A number of people draped in union flags later left the area and began spreading on to the nearby streets.
They then gathered in George Square again, singing Rule Britannia and a flare was let off.
The arrests are for various offences including disorder, breach of the peace and vandalism, Police Scotland said.
Six people were initially arrested in connection with the incident but police warned at the time that retrospective inquiries would be carried out which could lead to further arrests.

The trouble flared around tea time after hundreds of people gathered in George Square, which had been the focal point of the Yes campaign.
Nearby pubs locked in customers for their own safety and the entrance to the railway station was closed on police orders from 8pm onwards.
Six people were arrested at the time but police lifted another five on Saturday after setting up a dedicated incident room and examining pictures and videos. The number has now risen to 20.
