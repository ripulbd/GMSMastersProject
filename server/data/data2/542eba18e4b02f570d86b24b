They are satisfied that the food production processes within the Celtic Park kitchen, which caters for its hospitality areas, are appropriate and the food business operator concerned is co-operating fully with the investigation.&quot;Investigations are currently focusing on the external suppliers of ingredients however the Food Standards Agency have advised that there are currently no other related salmonella incidents which they are aware of relating to any of the foods involved.&quot;Dr Gillian Penrice, lead consultant in Public Health Medicine at NHSGGC, said: &quot;The incubation period for salmonella is usually between 24 - 72 hours, meaning that the likelihood of any new cases linked to this situation is small.&quot;All 11 cases are recovering at home and our investigations into the source are continuing.&quot;I would stress however that this appears to have been an isolated cluster of cases, that there is no ongoing risk to customers and that we are satisfied with the food handling and hygiene at Celtic Park.&quot;
