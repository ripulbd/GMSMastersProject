Cancer service is extended to all patients across city A PIONEERING service that aims to make sure no cancer patient copes alone has been extended to cover every newly diagnosed patient in Glasgow.The Improving the Cancer Journey project was launched in February, and began by contacting cancer patients with five of the most common cancers, offering them emotional, practical, financial and clinical support.Just over six months on, the project has helped more than 230 people deal with almost 1750 issues, including poor housing, problems looking after themselves at home and financial troubles.The scheme has been hailed such a success it is being extended this week to all newly diagnosed cancer patients in the city.Macmillan Cancer Support, which invested &pound;3million in the project, worked with Glasgow City Council, NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde, Cordia and Glasgow Life to set up the scheme.Head of the service Sandra McDermott said: &quot;We are delighted the pilot phase of this project has gone so well. However, it shows there is a huge number of cancer patients coping with problems without knowing where to go for help.&quot;Even we were surprised at how many issues cancer patients in Glasgow had been trying to cope with alone.&quot;Under the scheme - a UK first - every newly diagnosed cancer patient in Glasgow will be sent a letter offering a visit from a support worker.If the patient agrees, the worker will assess the patient and their family to see what help they need, then help them access it.Macmillan's director for Scotland, Elspeth Atkin-son, said: &quot;It will transform the experience of cancer patients by making sure no cancer patient will need to struggle on alone after diagnosis, unsure of where to turn for support.&quot;We hope the project will be replicated elsewhere.&quot;Glasgow City Council treasurer, Councillor Paul Rooney said: &quot;Diagnosis can have an immediate and lasting impact on every part of a patient's life, from their financial affairs to their family relationships.&quot;In Glasgow, we have been building the part-nerships and services to ensure that is understood in healthcare, in housing and in public services - so that nobody faces those challenges alone.&quot;Andrew Robertson, chairman of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: &quot;We are delighted that this service is being extended.&quot;To find out more call 0141 287 7077.catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk
