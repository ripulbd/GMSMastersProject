Glasgow based Matthew Algie keeps growing despite challenging market conditions Coffee roaster celebrates 150th anniversary with profits hike Coffee roaster celebrates 150th anniversary with profits hike - Daily Record Independent coffee roaster Matthew Algie is celebrating its 150th&nbsp;year of trading with continued growth.
The Glasgow based company enjoyed a jump in profits from &pound;2.5m to &pound;3.3m on the back of a 1.9 per cent increase in turnover to &pound;32.7m despite challenging market conditions, which have been affected by volatile raw coffee prices and currency exchange rates.
It attributed its success to innovation after broadening its product range and launching a number of new coffees, including a premium hand-roasted microlot range.
The company also made significant strides in developing its green coffee supply chain and supporting community-based coffee-growing projects.
&nbsp;It secured substantial financial backing through the Fair Development Fund (FDF) - a unique fund&nbsp;run by&nbsp;Comic Relief and Sainsbury's - to sustainably grow the Ugandan coffee industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Gumutindo Sustainability Project&nbsp;is a collaborative project that aims to improve coffee quality and farming practices for the benefit of local communities.&nbsp; Not only will this initiative support climate adaptation, but it will increase capacity and improve coffee quality - enabling more coffee to be sold at better prices.
&nbsp;Matthew Algie chairman, Eric Hagman, said: “The Matthew Algie team delivered another outstanding performance across 2013.&nbsp; Despite continuing to face the twin challenges of an extremely competitive marketplace and uncertainties in the global coffee trade, the company was able to demonstrate its commitment to upholding ethical values and meet its obligation to exceeding the expectations of our dedicated customer base.
&nbsp;“We will of course have to work extremely hard to maintain our position as the UK and Ireland’s leading independent coffee roaster, but we are confident that our investment in innovative new products and not only retaining but continuing to develop our highly skilled staff members will allow us to aim high in the years ahead.
&nbsp;“It is a challenge we are all passionate about, and I am very proud of everyone at Matthew Algie who has contributed to ensuring that our coffee, which is sold in coffee shops, restaurants and luxury hotels all over the country, continues to be sourced in a sustainable way and tastes great at the same time.”
