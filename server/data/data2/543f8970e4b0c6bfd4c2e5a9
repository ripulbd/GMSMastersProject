THOUSANDS of children are "living in fear" in violent homes across Greater Glasgow. Children living in fear of domestic violence THOUSANDS of children are "living in fear" in violent homes across Greater Glasgow.Some have witnessed seeing their mothers stabbed, strangled and sexually abused.In some cases children are also used as a manipulative tool by domestic thugs, or are forced to hear their mum insulted constantly.New figures show more than 4000 youngsters have witnessed domestic abuse since April this year.Glasgow Women's Aid say the numbers, collated by advocacy support group ASSIST, reveal the scale of the problem.They say their outreach service is desperately understaffed - and young people are having to wait up to two months for support.The service helps youngsters aged five to 18, who are living with domestic abuse and violence.Worker Elizabeth Wilson said some children have witnessed shocking sights as their mothers are attacked and abused.Children's team leader Marie Farry said: &quot;We have five workers in outreach but they're not all full time. We would like to see a lot more workers.&quot;Elizabeth added: &quot;We'd then be able to support more children who are living with abuse. They will start to feel safer, they will do better at school, they will have improved relationships and be able to function better in social situations.&quot;It's hard to think of young people on the waiting list.&quot;The city-wide service, which receives funding from the Scottish Government, involves one-to-one support and group work to support children and help them lead a healthy life.Youngsters can be referred from schools, health visitors, social work and the Glasgow Women's Aid drop in centre in Bell Street,Elizabeth said young people caught up in abuse are &quot;living in fear&quot;.She said: &quot;That fear can manifest itself in anxiety, poor school work, poor focus. Friendships are difficult, they have low self esteem, poor confidence.&quot;Sometimes it goes the other way, where they're angry or aggressive.&quot;Marie added: &quot;Some children will not attend school because they want to protect mum and other people will be really high achievers because school is their safe place.&quot;What we do recognise is that with the support they can go on to healthier lives, and they can have healthy relationships.&quot;Last year the service supported 60 children, and in the first nine months of this year they have already worked with 74 young people.Marie said: &quot;We support young people for as long as it takes.&quot;The workers teach anxiety techniques, discuss safety planning and relationships.During some sessions Elizabeth says youngsters will cry because &quot;it's a sense of relief&quot;.She said: &quot;Just when you think you won't hear anything more awful you do. But you see the change in children and young people when they've been coming to us.&quot;For that reason it's the best job I've ever had.&quot;
