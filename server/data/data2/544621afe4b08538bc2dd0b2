A LEADING academic has urged Glasgow to consider providing more homes for city centre living. Expert says homes will put heart back into city A LEADING academic has urged Glasgow to consider providing more homes for city centre living.Richard Bellingham is director of the Institute for Future Cities at Strathclyde University, which works to improve the quality of human life in cities across the world.He believes that, due to such factors as the increasing popularity of internet shopping, the future shape of cities will change.Mr Bellingham said: &quot;This might mean the existing dominance of retail space in the city centre is no longer required, which creates an issue around how we re-use that space in the future.&quot;There are some city centres which are pretty much dead in the evening, because the shops are closed and there is nothing much going on.&quot;However, he pointed out people have lived in the very centre of Edinburgh for hundreds of years.Mr Bellingham said having more people living in Glasgow city centre would support local shops, such as grocers and bakers, and could result in schools and health facilities opening.He added: &quot;We should start to reuse existing buildings as housing. The builders of Victorian warehouses did not think they would become penthouse flats, but they did.&quot;The same thing could happen to modern office and retail spaces, and it would be useful for city centre planners to look at that.&quot;The last thing you want in the city centre is lots of vacant space.&quot;I think change is inevitable and the fact is, the centre of Glasgow is already changing. Change is always happening in the city and we need to be ready.&quot;Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, agrees the city centre would benefit from having more homes.He said: &quot;We have a lot of buildings lying empty that no longer seem to meet market demand either for offices or upper floor retail spaces.&quot;Glasgow has a very low percentage of residents in the city centre compared to Manchester and more housing would clearly change the look and feel of the area.&quot;Mr Patrick said one of the problems is that many of the empty city centre buildings are owned by pension funds and insurance companies, who treat them as long term investments.He suggested the city should make it clear it would welcome an increase in city centre flats.The business leader added: &quot;We should try to persuade building owners to look at their portfolios and see if there are development opportunities they could bring forward with developers in the housing market.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
