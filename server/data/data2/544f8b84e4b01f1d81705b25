For some of the young athletes, this was their first ever experience in a long course pool.
And coach Jimmy Orr says it is essential for them to know what they will face when they head to championships later this year. He said: “Going to long course pools like the one in Stirling gives them essential practice for meets.
“Getting the feel for different pools gets them grounded and helps build their confidence.
“Swimming at Stirling also serves as great background as all the kids know that Ross swims there. It’s good motivation for them, and the kids can relate to Ross so it’s good for them to be swimming in the same pool as him.”
