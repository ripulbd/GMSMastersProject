Parents get letter over babies probe HUNDREDS of parents at the centre of the Glasgow babies' ashes scandal have received a heartfelt letter from Dame Elish Angiolini as a national cremation investigation begins.The parents hope the Govan-born former Lord Advocate, who is leading the inquiry, will hold the key to finding out what happened to the remains of their babies after cremation.Over the past few months the Evening Times has taken the lead in highlighting the babies' ashes scandal in Glasgow. Thanks to our extensive coverage more parents have joined the fight for legal action against crematoriums in the west and signed up to the nationwide inquiry.They were inspired to come forward after Stacey Lamb, Lee-Anne Gerry and Louise Chisholm touched their hearts with their stories.Stacey, 29, from Tollcross, who was the first to reveal her nightmare ordeal of losing son, Daniel, said Dame Elish's letter will give bereaving parents some answers and closure.Stacey said: &quot;When I got the letter I was upset because I know it will be a long, very difficult process, but at least now we are moving a step closer to grieving for our babies.&quot;I have every faith in Dame Elish that she will do her best for all of us and get us answers if there are any to be found.&quot;We may never know where our babies ashes went to, or see those responsible for discarding them and treating us with contempt brought to justice, but at least we will know our voices are being heard.&quot;Dame Elish, 54, was appointed by the Scottish Government to investigate babies ashes following an investigation by the Infant Cremation Commission led by Lord Bonomy.Stacey was one of hundreds of parents who received the letters as Dame Elish launched her official investigation.In her letter to Stacey, she wrote: &quot;May I take this opportunity to offer my sincerest sympathy for the great distress these matters have caused you and your loved ones.&quot;I understand this process may cause you considerable distress and urge you to seek support should you feel it would be beneficial.&quot;I am contacting you to explain how I plan to proceed and to inform you of how you may contribute to this process, if you so wish.&quot;I have now begun my investigation and have written to the 11 crematoria which have been identified by parents registered to be part of the investigation.&quot;I have requested the crematoria provide me with all records they hold for the babies registered to date.&quot;My intention is to interview staff and, where appropriate, former staff at the cremation authorities and crematoria before I meet parents.&quot;This is to ensure that when we meet I am able to answer your questions in as full a manner as possible.&quot;I may also require to speak to some health boards, depending on the circumstances of the case.&quot;As this will take some time, it is likely meetings with parents will commence from the new year. We will see any parent personally who wishes to be seen.&quot;I will write to update you on progress of the investigation.&quot;janice.burns@ eveningtimes.co.uk
