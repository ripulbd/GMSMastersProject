Children's charities call for childcare devolution CHILDREN'S charities met with Lord Smith to call for more powers to be used to improve childcare.The Smith Commission met earlier this week with the ten representatives of the five Scottish Parliament parties to begin negotiations on which powers should be devolved to Holyrood.Lord Smith said he wanted to engage with the wider public and organizations across society before recommendations are made before the end of this month.He met with Scotland's Childcare Alliance made up of officials from children's charities.Jackie Brock, Chief Executive of Children in Scotland, said more powers were needed to create a strong and dynamic future for our children and young people.She said: &quot;Childcare provides one example why we believe these powers must be devolved. We cannot secure a stronger economy and social justice without transforming our childcare system. If we are to achieve this, we require a genuinely integrated and coherent childcare system with all income tax and benefits decided by one government - not two.&quot;The Commission has until November 30 to reach agreement on which powers over taxation and welfare should be devolved to Scotland following the No vote in the independence referendum.Legislation is then to be drawn up by January 25 next year and be implemented and powers transferred after the UK General Election in May next year.The SNP had put childcare at the heart of its campaign for a Yes vote, arguing that increased tax returns from more parents in work would pay for the increased provision of childcare.Labour has also called for greater provision of affordable childcare, calling for a cap on the cost of childcare of 10% of the median family income.stewart.paterson@eveningtimes.co.uk
