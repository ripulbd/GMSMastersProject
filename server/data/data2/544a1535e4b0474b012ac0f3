King claims Ashley refused talks offer FORMER Rangers director Dave King launched a war of words with Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.The South Africa-based businessman claims the Sports Direct tycoon snubbed an invitation to meet with him about proposed investment at the Irbox club.King has tabled a &pound;16million offer to help the crisis-hit club. However, in return for the much-needed cash boost, he wants control of the Rangers board.Ashley recently increased his stake in Rangers and has a firm grip on the club's retail and merchandise deals, as well as a naming rights agreement for Ibrox.King, 59, issued a statement, which read: &quot;I attempted to meet with Mr Ashley on my visit, but neither he, nor his colleague, Mr Bishop, acknowledged my request.&quot;This is their right, but is unfortunate given the present concerns from supporters that Mr Ashley is using his shareholder status to put pressure on the board.&quot;King has now returned to South Africa without reaching a deal with the Ibrox board, despite a series of crunch talks in Glasgow.He added: &quot;We wish to appoint an equal number of members to the board and have the key say regarding the appointment of the chairperson.&quot;We will not invest funds and let the existing board determine how these funds are spent.&quot;Last month, Ashley doubled his stake in Rangers, giving him 8.92% of the operating company, just short of the 10% dual ownership limit agreed with the Scottish FA.In order to push his plan through, King needs support of 75% of Rangers' shareholders.Sandy Easdale, holds the voting rights on more than 26% of the total shares, meaning his support will be needed.King added: &quot;Sandy Easdale has apparently engaged constructively including highlighting some concerns.&quot;I have responded to these concerns in writing.&quot;He will now consult with his co-shareholders and hopefully revert soonest so that we can proceed to agreement and the earliest possible implementation thereof.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
