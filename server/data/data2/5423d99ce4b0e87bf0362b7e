Sick vandals target family memorial to tragic Moira VANDALS threw away a memorial stone and trashed flowers lain by the grieving family of murdered Moira Jones in the park where her body was found.Her brother Grant, 43, called police to Queens Park in Glasgow's South Side after a granite stone brought specially from the Highlands and engraved with her name was thrown down an embankment.There have been four incidents of vandalism in the past month at the &quot;private spot&quot; where Moira's parents Bea and Hu and her brother Grant, who lives near the park, visit regularly to &quot;reflect&quot; on their loss.But their special place has been desecrated and Grant is now calling for an end to these &quot;sickening acts&quot;.A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: &quot;It is clear that the people carrying out such acts give no thought to the family and friends and the distress and anguish suffered as a result.&quot;Last month Bea, 73, told the Evening Times how she was still haunted every day by the horror of 40-year-old's &quot;vile and barbaric&quot; rape and torture in the park after being abducted yards from her home in May, 2008.She tries desperately to focus on all the good memories she has of her sales adviser daughter but says sometimes &quot;awful things&quot; come into her head she can't shake off.Visiting the spot where Moira's body was dumped, to lay flowers and privately grieve means the world to Bea and her family.That's why Grant initially kept the vandalism secret from his mum. But after the series of incidents, he felt he had no choice but to break the news to her in case she returned one day and saw it herself.Photographer Grant said: &quot;We placed a memorial stone with Moira's name where her body was found and it is a place where my mum and dad and myself put flowers down and remember Moira.&quot;It is a private place where we can reflect and it's been fine for years but the past month there have been about four incidents of vandalism.&quot;The first time the flowers were strewn all over the place, a week or so later they had pulled the memorial stone out of the ground, thrown it down the embankment and trashed everything.&quot;They just went to town on it, stamping on the flowers we had left there and I was so sickened by what I saw I had to call the police.&quot;The police said they would keep an eye on it and tell other officers to be aware of it, too.&quot;We went up to the Highlands because Moira loved it up there and the hills, and picked a granite stone. We took it to Staffordshire to be engraved with her name and placed it at the spot where she was found.&quot;My worst fears were that my mum would go up there and discover the flowers she put there herself were vandalised.&quot;My mum was there a couple of weeks ago to put fresh flowers down and two days later I went there and they were s all over the place.&quot;It would have been awful if my mum had seen that.&quot;In another incident, the stone was hurled into bushes.&quot;My concern is that if that happens again we won't find the stone,&quot; said Grant.&quot;I am lost for words to describe how I feel about these people. What kind of person does some-thing like this?&quot;It must be the same people doing it time and again. I hope that by speaking about it maybe someone will see them doing it or know those responsible and report them to the police.&quot;janice.burns@ eveningtimes.co.uk
