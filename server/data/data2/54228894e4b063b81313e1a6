Clydeport failed tug death men crew A harbour authority has admitted breaching health and safety at work regulations after a tug sank nearly seven years ago claiming the lives of three men.The Flying Phantom was overtaken and pulled over by the larger bulk carrier, Red Jasmine, in fog as it was towing on the River Clyde on December 19 in 2007.The master of the tug, Stephen Humphreys, 33, from Greenock, engineer Robert Cameron, 65, from Houston, in Renfrewshire, and rating Eric Blackley, 57, from Gourock, all lost their lives. Ship's mate Brian Aitchison, then aged 37, survived. All the victims were married men with children.Clydeport Operations Limited admitted failing to have in place an adequate contingency plan if fog was encountered, especially when a large vessel was being towed.It also admitted failing to provide a safety management system and to appoint a suitable individual or individuals as the designated person.A trial was originally fixed in the case for the High Court in Edinburgh before a plea was negotiated.The owners of the tug, Svitzer Marine, were previously fined &pound;1.7 million.The judge, Lord Kinclaven, said that because of the issues raised and so that he could give proper consideration to documentary material he would adjourn sentence until Monday.Andrew Henderson, from Thompsons Solicitors, who acted for the families of the men, welcomed the news and said the Crown Office must now begin a fatal accident inquiry.He said: &quot;There can no more delay, thousands of men work in the marine industry on the Clyde and the lessons learned from a FAI will help protect their safety in the future.&quot;
