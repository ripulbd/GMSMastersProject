Stray snake found in Glasgow driveway The Scottish SPCA is appealing for the owner of a snake found on a Glasgow driveway.Scotland's animal welfare charity was alerted last Monday, September 29 after the cornsnake was spotted outside a property on Swinton Crescent.The snake, which is around a metre long, is now in the care of the Scottish SPCA's Glasgow Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in Cardonald, where he has been nicknamed Kaa.Animal Rescue Officer Kerry Friel said, &quot;The couple who found Kaa weren't too happy to come across him but they were brave enough to contain him until I arrived.&quot;They said he was lucky not to have been run over as he was difficult to spot in the dark due to his colouring.&quot;Cornsnakes are notorious escape artists so I think there's a good chance someone is missing Kaa.&quot;Hopefully his owner will come forward but if not we'll find him a suitable new home.&quot;Anyone who recognises Kaa is asked to contact the Scottish SPCA's Glasgow centre on 03000 999 999.
