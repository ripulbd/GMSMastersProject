Park friends stage protest to protect city greenspace CONSERVATION group the Friends of Victoria Park have staged a demonstration against Glasgow City Council's plans to lease part of the park for commercial use.Around 200 people came out to support the 'Arms around the Park' event to oppose the development of land on the former blaes football pitches near Westland Drive.The council said last year it was considering renting out park facilities in a bid to generate funds, and commissioned property consultants Ryden to undertake a feasibility study.In its report, Ryden listed potential uses for the parkland, including a shop, a pub or restaurant, a garden centre, an open-air market or children's soft play area.However, FoVP want the land used for community purposes only.Convener Robert Mellish said: &quot;People are only just becoming aware of what the city council's land services has done and it is causing a great of deal of distress.&quot;Any proposals would need planning approval and despite the financial problems the council is facing, we cannot seriously believe our councillors would go against their own local plan, their own structure plan, their own Climate Change Declaration and their policies on biodiversity to lease off prime parkland to a developer.&quot;Our Arms around the Park event is aimed at putting a stop to this nonsense and encouraging the council to sit down with us and discuss how best to maintain this park.&quot;A council spokesman said: &quot;We've always been very clear that, prior to reaching any conclusions, the results of this exercise will be fully shared with, and discussed with, local elected members, community councils, and any interested parties.&quot;iain.smith@ eveningtimes.co.uk
