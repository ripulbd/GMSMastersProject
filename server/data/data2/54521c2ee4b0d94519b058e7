 Versatile back Beale was fined &pound;24,600 by the Australian Rugby Union for sending an offensive picture message to a female ex-team official and was left out of the original touring party. 
 &quot;Kurtley at the moment is back at home and he is training,&quot; Grey said. 
 &quot;Once he is up to speed in terms of physical condition, he is definitely going to be considered for selection.&quot; 
 Grey added: &quot;He hasn't played for a long period of time so we know he is working hard and trying to get up to speed.&quot; 
 Beale, 25, missed two Tests against Argentina and New Zealand while he awaited the outcome of the disciplinary tribunal.
