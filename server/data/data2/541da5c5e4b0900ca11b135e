AP McCoy: Worcester inquiry over beer can thrown at jockey  Worcester Racecourse's management says it will thoroughly investigate an incident in which a beer can was thrown at champion jockey AP McCoy following a race at the track on Friday. 
 A man was removed by security officials after the can was hurled at McCoy. 
 The incident occurred after the jockey, 40, finished second on Saint Helena in the novices handicap hurdle. 
 Kate Hills, from Arena Racing Company, said: &quot;We've been in touch with AP and expressed our concerns.&quot; 
 She added: &quot;We told him we will thoroughly investigate the incident, and will take appropriate action.&quot; 
 Northern Irishman McCoy, who is on track for his 20th successive champion jump jockey title, won four of the earlier races at the fixture. 
 The British Horseracing Authority said it would also request a report from the racecourse. 
 Saint Helena hit the headlines earlier this month when landing a gamble at Southwell after McCoy was named as a late jockey change. It is not believed the two incidents are connected. 
 McCoy's four wins put him on 134 for the season so far, having already achieved his fastest century, with an unprecedented 300 wins for the campaign his target.
