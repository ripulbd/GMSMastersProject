Glasgow's first gin, Makar, and jewellery artist Euan McWhirter show off some of the top-end creativity in the city. Glasgow jewellery and gin: Makar drink makes guest appearance at Euan McWhirter new line launch - Daily Record TWO of Glasgow's makers teamed up this week to show off some of the city's top-end designs for a night out.
Jeweller Euan McWhirter launched his &quot;Metropolis&quot; range from his city centre studio together with Glasgow's first gin, Makar, which is already being flooded with orders from bars and Glaswegians.
The two businesses were recently promoting city creativity in India as part of the Scottish Development International tour and decided to team up.
Euan, whose work has been worn by Kylie and counts Shirley Manson as a fan, said the line was inspired by the original film, Metropolis, by Fritz Lang, and the 1920s.
He said: &quot;It's inspired by the 1920s but brought up to date with technicolor. I have always had inspiration from India, the colours and craft. There is a lot of traditional beading work that I've reinterpreted for the western market.&quot;
Liam Hughes, CEO of Glasgow Distillery Company who launched Makar on Monday, said they have had many bars calling for the city's first gin, and many bottles he has delivered himself to customers.
He said: &quot;We have seven outlets already and we have barely launched it. The feedback has been brilliant - people love it.
&quot;I hope people are more receptive because it says Glasgow on the label, but that just gets us through the door. People asking for it is the litmus test. I'm 100 per cent positive that Glasgow will step up to the mark and give Makar a try.&quot;
The Hillington-based firm will take delivery on Friday of two trucks of equipment from Germany as they prepare to make Glaswegian whisky next.
