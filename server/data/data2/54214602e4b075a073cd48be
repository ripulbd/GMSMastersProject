Miliband to say Scots made 'right choice' in referendum The Labour Party will show Scots they made the &quot;right choice&quot; rejecting independence, Ed Miliband is expected to say on Tuesday.
The Labour leader is due to tell his party's conference the issues discussed during the referendum are similar to those faced by people outside Scotland. 
He is expected to say a country that comes close to splitting apart &quot;is not a country in good health.&quot;
He will pledge to prove in &quot;the coming years&quot; Scotland was right to vote &quot;No&quot;.
On Monday evening, Mr Miliband told Scottish delegates in Manchester that promises made over more powers for Holyrood would be &quot;honoured.&quot; 
The three main parties pledged more devolution during the campaign to encourage Scots to reject independence, which they ultimately did by 55% to 45% last Thursday.
There has been disagreement, however, on whether increased powers for the Scottish Parliament should be accompanied by changes in the role of Scottish MPs at Westminster.
Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that the promised new powers for Scotland would be delivered.
At the party's conference in Manchester, Mr Miliband claimed that a future Labour government would create the more fair and just society that both &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; voters called for in the independence referendum. 
At the annual Scottish reception, the Labour leader praised those who helped keep Scotland in the union.
He won the loudest applause when he mentioned former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's role during the final weeks of the campaign. 
In a swipe aimed at his political opponents, he said: &quot;Let no one set England, Wales and Scotland against each other because we have just spent the last two years keeping our UK together and we are not going to stand for it.&quot; 
&quot;It was an absolute promise that was made and it's a promise that has absolutely got to be delivered,&quot; Ms Harman said.
&quot;If you make a promise on the eve of an election and you say: if you vote 'No' you will get more powers devolved, then that is absolutely what's going to happen.&quot;
Her comments came after shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would not vote for a &quot;rushed&quot; constitutional settlement that &quot;would not work&quot; in the wake of the Scottish referendum.
Ms Harman said: &quot;There will be some changes further on down the line in relation to England, but that makes no difference to what was promised to Scotland and what will be delivered to Scotland.&quot;
She added: &quot;I do think that we do have to look at the anomaly where Scottish MPs can vote, for example, on English education, which doesn't affect their constituents, and English MPs don't get to vote on Scottish education.
&quot;But I think identifying that there is a problem that needs to be sorted out is much easier than identifying what the solution is and getting a solution that doesn't make matters worse.&quot;
In his keynote speech to conference on Tuesday, Mr Miliband is expected to say: &quot;We will show the people of Scotland over the coming years that they made the right choice. Because we are better together.&quot;
The labour leader will tell the story of meeting a Scottish voter who complained about low wages in her workplace.
He is due to say: &quot;I don't know how she voted, but I do know the question she was asking: 'Is anything going to make life better for me and my family?'
&quot;I hear Josephine's question everywhere, not just in Scotland. 'Can anyone build a better future for the working people of Britain?'
&quot;It wasn't just the referendum question. It is the general election question.&quot;
On Monday, Better Together chairman Alastair Darling told the Labour conference in Manchester that Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond had &quot;lost the plot&quot; after voters rejected independence.
Mr Darling said his opponent must accept the outcome of the referendum.
The comments came after Mr Salmond claimed voters were &quot;tricked&quot; into voting &quot;No&quot; by Westminster leaders.
Labour also used its conference to reach out to supporters who voted for independence to come &quot;home&quot; to the party.
Pro-independence parties, including the SNP and the Scottish Greens, have reported surges in membership following last Thursday's &quot;No&quot; vote in the independence referendum.
Scottish voters backed the country staying in the UK by 2,001,926 votes to 1,617,989.
