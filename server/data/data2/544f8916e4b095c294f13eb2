Susan Boyle helps at Edinburgh poppy factory Scottish singer Susan Boyle has been helping dispatch poppies at an Edinburgh factory ahead of the 2014 Scottish Poppy Appeal in November. 
Ms Boyle, a long-standing supporter of the charity which runs the annual Scottish Poppy Appeal, Poppyscotland, was at Lady Haig's Poppy Factory.
The singer met the 40 veterans with disabilities who work at the factory.
She then helped load some of the five million poppies on to vehicles for distribution across Scotland. 
Five million poppies and more than 10,000 wreaths are made annually at the historic factory.
Ms Boyle said: &quot;It was a pleasure to meet the veterans who make poppies all year round for the Scottish Poppy Appeal before sending them to the many volunteers across the country.
&quot;It is a fascinating process and I hope that when the poppies start to appear in our shops, schools and businesses in the coming weeks, the Scottish public will once again show their support.&quot; 
Charlie Pelling, Lady Haig's Poppy Factory manager said: &quot;We are delighted that Susan joined us today.
&quot;The dispatch of poppies for the appeal is an important milestone in our calendar as it marks the culmination of a year of hard work.
&quot;This year we have seen a high demand for wreaths and other Remembrance items because of First World War centenary events and we expect this to continue over the next four years. Susan's visit gave the guys a real boost.&quot;
