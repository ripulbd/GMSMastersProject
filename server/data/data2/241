ALCOHOL related death rates are 72% higher in areas of Glasgow with the highest number of off-sales, a study has found. Extra off-sales mean early deaths for city residents ALCOHOL related death rates are 72% higher in areas of Glasgow with the highest number of off-sales, a study has found.The research backs up previous claims that over-provision of alcohol licences, which drives down prices, is the main source of problem drinking.People who live in the Merchant City area, including the Saltmarket and Gallowgate, are three times more likely to be admitted to hospital with booze related problems, including liver disease and alcohol poisoning.Residents have access to 36 off-sales, compared with an average of 8.6 city-wide, and 301 licensed premises including bars, restaurants and clubs.The area around Sauchiehall Street had the second highest number of off-licenses, including supermarkets, at 34, with 307 licensed premises in total.Alcohol-related hospital admission rates in the city were 50% above the Scottish average.The highest number of off-sales was recorded in Edinburgh, with 54 in one area of the city.The Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh compared the number of alcohol outlets within Scottish neighbourhoods with records of alcohol-related hospitalisations and deaths.Across Scotland, there were 34 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people in neighbourhoods with the most off-sales outlets, compared with 13 per 100,000 in areas with the fewest outlets.Researchers said the lack of attention paid to the link between off-licence provision and alcohol-related harm had been a &quot;serious oversight,&quot; and called on local authorities to tackle the issue.Licensing chiefs also called on the Scottish Government to re-examine the laws on over-provision.Figures from 2011-2012 show the city of Glasgow had 518 off sales, with a total of 1748 licences premises.Scotland has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related harm in Western Europe.Across Glasgow, there were 2622 alcohol-related deaths from 2002-2011.Dr Evelyn Gillan, Chief Executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, which released the report, said: &quot;If we want fewer people to end up in hospital or lose their lives because of alcohol, then we have to be concerned about the high number of alcohol outlets in our neighbourhoods.&quot;Licensing boards have a key role to play in regulating the overall number of licensed premises and their decisions should be informed by studies such as this.&quot;Paul Waterson, Chief Executive of The Scottish Licensed Trade, said: &quot;We would tend to agree with the report. Councils have to have over-provision policies in place that work.&quot; We would urge the Scottish Government to re-examine the law on over-provision.&quot;A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: &quot;The board has a robust policy on over-provision of licences, which seeks to manage the availability of alcohol across the city while respecting the rights of the licensed trade.&quot;The board has identified 14 over-provided areas in the city, where there is a presumption against further licences being issued, with four other areas on a watch list.&quot;However, depending on the merits of an individual case, the board retains the right to refuse any liquor licence application on the basis of overprovision.&quot;Plans to introduce a minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland could be delayed for years as the Scottish Government fights a series of legal challenges from the drinks industry.caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
