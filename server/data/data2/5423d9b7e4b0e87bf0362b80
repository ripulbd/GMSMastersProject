PARENTS fighting to rescue a primary from severe overcrowding problems said they sympathise with an adjoining nursery facing the axe. New school feels the squeeze PARENTS fighting to rescue a primary from severe overcrowding problems said they sympathise with an adjoining nursery facing the axe.But the Space for Hillhead campaign group and Hillhead Primary Parent Council believe the best way forward is to move Kelvin Park Early Years Centre.The parent council said it has been negotiating for more than a year with Glasgow City Council to try and find solutions to the space problem.It believes the simplest and lowest-cost solution is to move the EYC off site to allow the school adequate space for its children.Currently there is no library, art room, no music room, IT room or break out spaces in the West End school, as they have all been converted into classrooms.When the school was relocated from Cecil Street to its new Otago Street location it was merged with three other primaries.But pupils numbers at what is now the largest primary in Glasgow were underestimated.Mum Dr Sarah Lowndes has a daughter in P7 at the school and a son in P4.She said: &quot;There is no compelling reason for EYC to be on the Hillhead site, it could be relocated without negatively affecting those children.&quot;However, P7 children need to remain in the school and not shipped off a year early because the council can't take responsibility for and deal with their error in admitting too many children to Hillhead Primary.&quot;I am not buying the so-called benefits of sending the P7s to the High School (such as using science labs, and allegedly easing the transition to S1).&quot;This is just flannelling. Glasgow City Council need to admit they have made a series of errors in planning and decision making and make a long term plan.&quot;The most sensible solution is for the city council to invest in relocating and expanding the EYC.In response, Councillor Stephen Curran, Executive Member for Education and Young People, said today: &quot;We are keen to spend time speaking and listening to the views of all interested parties.&quot;HE went on: &quot;We understand that feelings are running high and there is a lot of debate over some of the proposals to date.&quot;This is why the alternative option - retaining Kelvin Park Early Years Centre in Hillhead Primary School campus with additional teaching spaces in Hillhead High for the use of the primary school - is being added to the current consultation document.&quot;If agreed, this proposal would free up much needed space within Hillhead Primary with the additional benefits of access to specialist resources a secondary school can offer.&quot;It will not mean that the P7 children will no longer be part of the Hillhead Primary community.&quot;It would also mean that the nursery provision would stay next to the school.&quot;All parents and carers at the schools and nurseries involved have been sent home the alternative proposal to consider and let us know their thoughts.&quot;&quot;I would urge everyone with an interest in the schools involved to look at the new option and respond to the consultation with their thoughts by Monday 10 November.&quot;catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk
