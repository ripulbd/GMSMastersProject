WE delve into the Daily Record archives for some classic black and white images from the Glasgow derby between Celtic and Rangers. In pictures: The Old Firm derby in black and white, 1900-1950 - Daily Record 
THERE has been a lot of talk about the return of the Glasgow derby this week, with Celtic and Rangers both in the hat in Saturday's Scottish League Cup draw.
Incredibly, for a match that was played seven times in the 2010/11 season alone, it's been over two years since the sides last met following Rangers' collapse and reemergence in the lower divisions.
Celtic's John Guidetti and Serbian strike partner Stefan Scepovic most definitely fancy it. Rangers boss Ally McCoist not so much.
What can't be argued is that Scottish football has been missing its biggest match in recent seasons, a spectacle that has thrilled and occasionally frightened us all.
Today we bring you part one of a special Glasgow derby picture gallery, delving into the Daily Record archives and picking out some rare and striking black and white images.
