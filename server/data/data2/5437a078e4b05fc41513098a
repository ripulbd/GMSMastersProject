Pervert is locked up for 6 years A MAN is behind bars after a large scale probe into child sexual exploitation.Javaid Akhond, 20, preyed on young girls luring them into sex by splashing the cash and inviting them to drink-fuelled house parties.One victim - aged just 12 when targeted while she was out with friends - told a jury how she thought he &quot;loved&quot; her.Akhond was snared by Police Scotland's Operation Dash, set up in 2013 to root out child sexual exploitation in Strathclyde.He was locked up for six years in what is thought to be the operation's first conviction.He prowled Glasgow city centre and started grooming a 12-year-old girl in 2011 after approaching her as she was ice skating with friends.He then targeted her 13-year-old friend and went on to have intercourse with a 15-year-old girl in 2013.He was convicted of rape, two grooming charges and two charges of assault following a trial last month.At the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Turnbull said: &quot;The evidence satisfied me that you actively sought out to target and groom young vulnerable girls who you knew to be much younger than you and who you expected to be impressionable.&quot;
