We have managed to keep on a couple of the deli staff.&quot;I think people will be glad to see some of the old faces.&quot;The couple, who previously worked in the transport and logistics business, will specialise in fresh bread, French deli products, coffee and cakes.Gina said: &quot;I'm not in the food business but we have put a lot of thought into this.&quot;I have friends who have bistros in France so we have a clear idea of what we want.&quot;We're going to put lots of investment in.&quot;Gina said she was impressed with the mix of shops in Skirving Street.She said: &quot;There's lots of lovely shops and places to eat or get coffee.&quot;You've got Butterfly Kisses just across the road and there's a new jewellers.&quot;There's also a make-up artist, which is helping to bring lots of people to the area.&quot;Neighbouring businesses welcomed the news.Noelle Carroll, owner of Young's Interesting Books, said: &quot;It just goes to show that Skirving Street is a happening place.&quot;The doors have only just closed and somebody is moving in. I'm very pleased that a similar deli store is opening because it brings something different to the street.&quot;rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk
