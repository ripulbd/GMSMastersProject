Child, 27, from Perth, represented Britain at London 2012 and took silver at Glasgow 2014. She celebrated gold at the European Championships in the summer.
She said: “I am extremely proud to be one of the charity’s first ambassadors.
“I have been really inspired meeting some of the cancer nurses funded by the charity, not to mention the positive attitude of patients and families affected by this dreadful disease.
“I want to do as much as I can to boost fundraising.”
Head of fundraising Charlene Elliott said: “It’s fantastic to have a much-loved Scottish Olympian and European champion on board as one of our first ambassadors.
“We are grateful that Eilidh has chosen to give her time to help us raise the profile of the charity and support our fundraising activities.”
