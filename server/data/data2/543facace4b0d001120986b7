MALCOLM CARMICHAEL was a member of the group, considered the Union J or One Direction of the day, and is looking to reunite with his old buddies. Francis Langford Singing Scholars reunion on the cards as ex variety performer makes plea for former members to get in touch - Daily Record A FORMER variety performer is looking for the Glaswegian compatriots he wowed city audiences with in the 1950s.
Malcolm Carmichael was a member of the popular Francis Langford Singing Scholars, who toured across Britain and Europe.
Joining the act in 1957 aged 17, the London lad formed fast friendships with the troupe before being forced away in 1960 for National Service.
Glasgow Now helped Malcolm reunite with some of his old friends earlier this year. Now the 74-year-old is hoping to trace the rest.
He said: “It would be wonderful if we could track down more of the guys. There was such a strong bond between the lads. We worked as a team to make the act successful.
“We were all great friends and enjoyed working with some of the biggest stars in show business
 . 

“A few of the lads have passed away but it would be fantastic if ones that are still about would make contact.”
Formed in 1954 by Welshman Francis Langford, the Scholars were forerunners of today’s One Direction and Union J. Aged 15 to 19, they covered popular ballads, semi- classical songs and rock &amp; roll.
They enjoyed seasons at the Pavilion with Johnny Beattie, Jack Milroy and Billy Rusk, as well as appearing at Edinburgh’s Palladium,the Palace in Dundee and the Tivoli, Aberdeen.
The Scholars made a film in 1955 called Fun At St Fanny’s, a male equivalent of the Belles of St Trinian’s starring a young Ronnie Corbett.
 

Malcolm wants to trace Billy Caldwell, Roy Macinally, Jimmy McCardle, Jimmy Hughes, Tommy Shepherd and Billy McCourt from Glasgow, Derek Scott of Edinburgh, Carl Spragg of Cardiff, Peter Williams of Swansea, Alf Kelly of Blackpool and Eddy Wright from Plymouth. Email reporters@glasgownow.co.uk.
