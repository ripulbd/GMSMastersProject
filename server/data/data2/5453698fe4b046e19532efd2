The bottled lager, which is brewed at the Wellpark brewery in Glasgow, will initially be stocked by supermarkets Tesco and Sainsburys in Scotland from this weekend.
Tennent's marketing director, Paul Condron, said: “Black T is a bit of a dark horse in the premium lager category –– but we think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised when they try it.
“This is the first time we’ve looked to build a family of Tennent’s beers, which is exciting. Tennent’s has never stood still and has kept moving with the times throughout its 450-year history.
“Right now, we see demand for different types of beer for different occasions, whether it’s a bit of a treat on a Friday night, or a light beer on a Sunday afternoon.
“Our new Tennent’s family gives that choice and complements our core Tennent’s Lager.”
Tennent Caledonian, owned by Irish drinks firm C&amp;C Group, also launched a low alcohol 'lemon lager' called Lemon T earlier in the year.
