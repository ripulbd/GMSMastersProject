COMPULSORY charges for carrier bags have received a mixed reaction from the public. Mixed emotions as carrier bag tax hits the high street COMPULSORY charges for carrier bags have received a mixed reaction from the public.It will now cost at least 5p for each single-use carrier bag as the charge covers all retailers including supermarkets, high street stores, corner shops and takeaways.The move is aimed at combating Scotland's litter problem and reducing the environmental damage caused by plastic bagsDerek Robertson, chief executive of Keep Scotland Beautiful, said: &quot;We have a unique reach across Scotland to deliver real change with these funds.&quot;We've delivered significant environmental improvements before and these bag charge proceeds will allow us to do more, making Scotland cleaner, greener and more sustainable.&quot;However some shoppers have expressed concerns about the &quot;carrier bag tax&quot;.Keiran Gallogley, from Airdire, said: &quot;My parents spend around &pound;200 a week on one big shop, and they use about 20 bags.&quot;It's adding an expense and nobody has 20 'Bags For Life' in their back pocket.&quot;The Scottish Government estimates 800 million single-use carrier bags are handed out by supermarkets alone in Scotland each year, and believes councils pick up around 7.4m bags a year.Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: &quot;Huge numbers of these bags end up as litter, blighting our communities and clogging up our seas and natural habitats, affecting many sorts of wildlife and marine species.&quot;We want that to change and for people to stop and think about whether they really need to take another bag. Alternatives like bags for life are easy to get and much more sustainable.&quot;He said it was &quot;extremely heartening&quot; to see retailers sign up to the scheme, which includes a pledge to donate money raised through the charge to charities across Scotland.Figures have shown similar charges introduced in Wales and Northern Ireland saw drops in new bag use of around 80% and 70% respectively, environmental groups said.Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: &quot;Plastic bags are just one symbol of our throwaway society and charging for their use is an important step in changing people's behaviour.&quot;If the Scottish public don't respond positively to this then we should examine other options including increasing the charge per bag or phasing out the sale of single-use plastic bags.&quot;MSPs overwhelmingly backed the introduction of the charge in a vote at Holyrood earlier this year.Iain Gulland, director of Zero Waste Scotland, slammed single-use carrier bags as an &quot;absurdity&quot;He said: &quot;In Scotland we use hundreds of millions of single-use bags a year - an absurdity when you consider the resources used to make and transport an item for one use, before ending up as landfill or litter.&quot;The charge applies regardless of whether the bags are paper, plastic or biodegradable.rebecca.gray @eveningtimes.co.uk
