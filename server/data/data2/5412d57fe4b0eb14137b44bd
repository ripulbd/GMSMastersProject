THE "bravest street in Scotland" is said to have lost more soldiers in the Great War than any other road. Pupils' plaque plan to mark 'bravest street' of Great War THE "bravest street in Scotland" is said to have lost more soldiers in the Great War than any other road.And now children at a school at St George's Cross are leading the charge to erect a new war memorial to honour the dead of Glasgow's Lyon Street.Youngsters at Oakgrove Primary plan to replace a plaque that commemorated the fallen soldiers who had lived in a street near their school.The dead were brothers, cousins and friends who lived in Victorian tenements along Lyon Street. But the road and surrounding streets were cleared when the buildings were bulldozed from the 1960s to the 1980s. Gone too was a wooden commemorative plague.Oakgrove's head teacher Jane Cerexhe, said: &quot;Our P6 pupils started to learn about the First World War last year and were fascinated by the story of Lyon Street.&quot;At the time was known as the 'bravest street in Scotland' as it was said to have lost more men than any other street in the country.&quot;The fact that this happened so close to the school has brought the project to life for the pupils and they have taken this story into their hearts.&quot;They are keen to replace the missing memorial to the fallen and have done a lot of research but would appreciate the help and stories of anyone with knowledge of Lyon Street and the local area.&quot;The children are working alongside others at neighbouring St Joseph's Primary, community groups and the local community council.Oakgrove has also enlisted the help of developers at Abstract (Glasgow) Ltd who are behind the new &pound;70million office block St Vincent Plaza and which recently provided the school with an eco playground.Development manager Archie Blair said: &quot;It is fundamental that the younger generation learns about First World War and the legacy that it has had on their area.&quot;The pupils at Oakgrove have put their all into this project and we are delighted to support them all the way in replacing this lost memorial.&quot;The young investigators have researched local records and libraries but now hope residents who know the story of Lyon Street will come forward and tell what they know.The school is organising a drop in cafe on Tuesday, September 30, and hope members of the public with information will pop along for a chat.Information, memories and views on what form the new memorial should take can be emailed to lisa@skylarkpublicrelations.comgordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
