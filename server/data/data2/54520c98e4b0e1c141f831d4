Teenager in warning over bonfire threat A TEENAGER left scarred for life after an accident on bonfire night is warning other young people to be aware of the dangers.Ross Clark was just 10 when he suffered extensive burns after attempting to use petrol to set a bonfire alight.The liquid, which had splashed onto Ross' hand, ignited and the flames engulfed his hand, arm and face.Ross, now 14 and a &shy;pupil at St Peter the Apostle High School in Clydebank, and his mum Lynne were speaking about the accident in the run up to Guy Fawkes' Night to warn other young people to steer clear of accelerants and bonfires.The youngster was playing with pals on the afternoon of November 5, 2010.The group had built a bonfire in their local park in Faifley but due to heavy rain decided to use petrol and a lighter to start the fire.Ross, who was a pupil at St Joseph's Primary at the time, was burned when the petrol fumes ignited and set his jacket alight.His life was saved when he adopted the stop, drop and roll manoeuvre he had learned at school days earlier.He said: &quot;When I saw the flame I just dropped down and rolled myself in the grass&quot;I asked my pal if I was okay and he thought I was but I could feel the burning, so I ran to my gran's for help.&quot;Mum Lynne added: &quot;When my mum saw Ross the skin had started to peel from his hand and face. She called for an ambulance and Ross was rushed to Yorkhill Hospital.&quot;I was at work when I got a call to say Ross had burned his hand. Ross' dad picked me up at work and it was only when we got to Yorkhill we realised how bad it was.&quot;I could see the skin was peeling off his face and it was swollen to twice its normal size. I just panicked and completely broke down. Within two hours he was in intensive care.&quot;Ross, who can remember very little about the accident, was put into an induced coma for five days and spent a week in intensive care followed by a further four weeks in hospital.
