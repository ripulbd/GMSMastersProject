A YOUNG man has spoken of his double tragedy after losing two friends who drowned in the same canal. Security plea after man loses 2 pals in city canal tragedies A YOUNG man has spoken of his double tragedy after losing two friends who drowned in the same canal.Darren McCafferty told the Evening Times about his struggle to come to terms with the loss of his pals Stuart Davis and Kristopher Boyle, who died three years apart.The 23-year-old, from Possil, said: &quot;It's hard, really hard. And we're all hurting.&quot;Now Darren, a security agent with Rangers FC, is calling for improved security, warning signs and lighting around the Forth and Clyde canal in Glasgow.He was joined by Kristo-pher Boyle's grieving mother who backed calls for new safety measures. Kim Keely has been left heartbroken by her son's recent death.Stuart, 23, died in the canal, close to Speirs Wharf, in the city's Port Dundas, in October 2011.He fell in after a night out in Glasgow city centre with his girlfriend.Kristopher, 24, was found dead in the same stretch of water last month.Darren, who has launched a petition calling for improve-ments, said: &quot;That's two people we've lost because of the canal.&quot;They were people's sons, brothers, and friends - that's why I think something should be done about security around the canal.&quot;A high fence and better lighting might mean this will never happen again, and we won't lose anyone else.&quot;Dozens of tributes, including floral bouquets and football tops, have been left on a bridge over the Forth and Clyde Canal, near to where Kristopher, a joiner, was found.Standing at the canal side, Darren said: &quot;Something needs to be done and that's why I've launched this petition.&quot;Around 200 people have already signed it and most of the local businesses have said they will back me.&quot;Our comm-unity has lost too many people because of this canal.&quot;Around 500 people turned out for Kristo-pher's funeral in Lambhill on Monday.Darren said Kristopher's family have been left &quot;in bits&quot; by the tragedy.He said: &quot;It's so hard when someone is taken away so quickly.&quot;And we are still waiting to find out exactly how Kristopher ended up in the water.&quot;His family and friends are in the dark, and the not knowing exactly what happened makes it even harder for everyone.&quot;It's just so unfair.&quot;It's hard when you think about Kristopher not being here.&quot;He was a really nice guy, we'd known each other about 10 years.&quot;Kristopher was into football, keeping fit and he loved his cars. He was always there for other people.&quot;DARREN has already gained support from a host of local people, including Sandra White MSP, who is also calling for something to be done.She said: &quot;I have written to Glasgow City Council and the canals network asking what can be done to improve safety in the area.&quot;I've spoken to people who live near the canal and they agreed there is really nothing between the canal and the pathway.&quot;Installing CCTV, lighting and a fence would help - or even a sign.&quot;People need to know to be alert when walking along this canal.&quot;A Scottish Canals spokeswoman said: &quot;We would like to extend our sympathies to the friends and family following the recent tragic incident.&quot;We will be undertaking a further review of the area to see if there are any aspects of visitor safety that we can improve and have written to Mr McCafferty to inform him.&quot;We will contact him again with the outcome of the review.&quot;It is not possible to install fencing along every stretch of Scotland's canals.&quot;They pose the same risks as any open body of water and every year we work with local authorities over our Stay Safe campaign, which encourages the public to stay away from the edge.&quot;Regenerating North Glasgow is a major focus for Scottish Canals and our partners.&quot;We are investing in new assets along the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal at Pinkston Watersports Centre and a new wakeboarding hub, which will be opening soon.&quot;These developments wil not only increase footfall, and bring greater animation to the canal at Port Dundas but will also improve lighting and the wider security of the area.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
