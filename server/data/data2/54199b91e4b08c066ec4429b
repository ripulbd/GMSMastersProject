THE woman living with hotel boss's daughter Aqsa Mahmood in Syria said she wishes it was her who had executed the American journalist. 'Sister' of Glasgow jihadi bride makes vile Twitter rant about Steven Sotloff beheading - Daily Record A SO-CALLED “sister” of jihadi war bride Aqsa Mahmood has told how she wishes she had beheaded a US journalist.
Scots runaway Mahmood, 20, is living with a woman calling herself Umm Ubaydah in Syria while their husbands fight for the barbaric Islamic State.
Yesterday, Ubaydah was asked on her blog what she thought about the killing of Steven Sotloff , the American slaughtered in Syria.
Ubaydah, who is believed to be a Somali-born Brit, wrote: “I wish I did it.”
 

On Tuesday, IS released a video of a British thug known as Jihadi John murdering Sotloff, 31. He then threatened to execute a Scots hostage.
Mahmood enjoyed a privileged childhood in Glasgow, where her dad is a hotel boss. But in February, she married an IS fighter. Her parents Khalida and Muzaffar told a press conference this week they are horrified at what she has become.

Yesterday, her Canadian “sister” Umm Haritha continued to issue warnings after Mahmood was exposed as a terrorist wife.
She wrote on Twitter: “The kuffar (disbelievers) are going to regret all that they have caused. They asked for this trouble. They chose to destroy their own lives and economies.”
While Mahmood, now called Umm Layth, deleted her Twitter account, the trio continue to share public messages.

Sharing a picture of kittens, Ubaydah wrote: “My sisters. We made hijrah (the journey) together, May Allah grant us shahada (faith) together and unite us in Jannah (paradise).”
Haritha said: “What’s with you and cats plz. PS I’m the cute furry angry one. Suits my personality.”
“Too late, Umm Layth claimed that one,” Ubaydah said.
