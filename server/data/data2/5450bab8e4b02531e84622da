CELEBRITY chef Ferrier Richardson has spoken of his grief and anger over the loss of his beloved brother who was brutally murdered in Glasgow city centre. Our brother was just like a saint... and he didn't deserve to die like this CELEBRITY chef Ferrier Richardson has spoken of his grief and anger over the loss of his beloved brother who was brutally murdered in Glasgow city centre.Ferrier, who is personal chef to the President and First Lady of Gabon, and his wife Ann-Marie, said they want justice for Simon and hoped his killer would be &quot;put away for a very long time&quot;.He spoke out after killer Luke Quinn, 33, was yesterday convicted of murder after he left Simon Richardson dying in the street after a horrific assault which involved knocking him to the ground and stamping on him as he lay defenceless.Hours later Quinn, of Busby, East Renfrewshire, boasted to his Taekwon Do instructor by text about what he had done.Ferrier and his family's lives were ripped apart on November 10 last year when Simon, 45, was set upon and robbed in Glasgow's Wellington Street after a night out with his best friends.His injuries were so severe he later died at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary.Simon worked as a front of house manager for his brother Ferrier, who owned a string of restaurants in Glasgow before moving to West Africa four years ago.But he gave up his life to look after their mum Ann 13 years ago, after she suffered a stroke, dementia and cancer.Simon's family said that just weeks after the murder, Ann died at the age of 77 on Christmas Eve &quot;of a broken heart&quot; because she was lost without her son.He rarely went out because he refused to leave her alone but on the day he was killed he had gone out to watch his favourite team St Mirren play Partick Thistle, and then went for a meal and a few drinks.Ferrier said: &quot;Simon had gone to the match with my son and two of his best mates he had known since he was five, they left each other in good spirits and went their separate ways around midnight as they all live in different areas.&quot;Within 20 minutes of that Simon was beaten and taken to hospital.&quot;Someone beat him and then went through his pockets and then had another go.&quot;I don't care what my brother said or did that night, nobody on earth deserves anything like that.&quot;He said the image of Simon in the mortuary would &quot;live with me for the rest of my life.&quot;&quot;It was absolutely horrendous. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.&quot;The award-winning chef flew back to his native city of Glasgow at the weekend to attend Simon's trial.The dad-of-two has bought a house in Glasgow's east end and plans to return in two years.He said: &quot;Simon was a wonderful human being, who everyone loved. I could not have asked for a better brother.&quot;What this excuse for a human being has done to all of us, I would not wish on your or any other person's family.&quot;He should be locked away for a very long time so that no other family has to suffer in the way we have.&quot;Ferrier and his wife Ann-Marie said it was so sad that Simon was robbed of the chance to be with his mum when she died and to rebuild his life.He said: &quot;I don't know what we would have done without him. He cared for our mum for 13 years. He was great with her and had the patience of a saint.&quot;We knew at some point she was going to die but there is no doubt what happened to Simon brought it on.&quot;Simon should have had the honour of being with her at the end after everything he had done for her but he was robbed of that.&quot;Even if Simon got hit with a bus I could have lived with it. What happened to him just wasn't right. It doesn't sit easy with me. None of our family have ever been in trouble with the police in any shape or form in our whole lives.&quot;I want justice for Simon. I wouldn't want any other family to go through this. If this guy can do it once he can do it again.&quot;At Simon's funeral, Ferrier said he was so bitter and angry at what had happened to Simon he could barely speak.He added: &quot;I had so much hatred inside me, anything I said just wouldn't have been appropriate.&quot;It is difficult to come to terms with what happened.&quot;Ferrier, who was the first chairman of Glasgow's Restaurateur Association, and creator of some of the city's most prestigious restaurants including Yes and Eurasia, added: &quot;I was on the Glasgow tourist board for many years and I fear for Glasgow now and our society as a whole.&quot;I worry about my children all the time.&quot;His wife Ann-Marie, 54, who had known Simon since he was six-years-old, said he was &quot;the nicest guy on the planet, very kind hearted and generous&quot;.She added: &quot;He was definitely not a person who would want to be involved in an argument. He would rather calm down a situation than cause any trouble.&quot;He was very caring person and cared for his mum for 13 years after his dad died on his own with no carers.&quot;He gave up his whole life to look after her. He didn't socialise much because he refused to leave his mum alone and when he did go out it would only be for an hour or so a few times a week to get food in or go to the football.&quot;His mum had a stroke and when his dad died he kept his dying wish that she would never go into a home and he looked after her.&quot;For the last three years she had dementia and was diagnosed with cancer last July. She died on Christmas morning, six weeks after Simon was murdered, it was mainly to do with a broken heart. Even though she had dementia she still knew she had lost Simon.&quot;She was lost without him. He was her life because he did so much for her.&quot;We miss him so much. Nothing was too much trouble for him. He would have done anything for you.&quot;Speaking after yesterday's hearing, Ferrier said: &quot;We are also relieved that this person is off the street and can no longer do what he has done to us as a family to anyone else.&quot;I hope he gets put away for a very long time.&quot;He thanked the jury for &quot;coming to this conclusion.&quot;Tele sales worker Quinn denied murder and claimed that he was suffering from diminished responsibility due to Aspergers Syndrome.Judge Bill Dunlop QC deferred sentence on him until next month.janice.burns @eveningtimes.co.uk
