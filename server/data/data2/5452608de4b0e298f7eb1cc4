Scotland's biggest local authority expects to see a rising council tax take next year - but said the SNP's "unfunded council tax freeze" continues to put pressure on services. Matheson: years of disproportionate cuts from Scottish Government are putting pressure on services Scotland's biggest local authority expects to see a rising council tax take next year - but said the SNP's "unfunded council tax freeze" continues to put pressure on services.Labour-led Glasgow City Council expects to balance the books despite &quot;year after year of disproportionate cuts&quot; from the Scottish Government.The city's financial forecast for 2015/2016 says it will need to find savings to meet a spending gap of &pound;28.9 million.Although the total local government budget in Scotland is the same as last year, Glasgow will again receive a smaller percentage of the available budget, resulting in a &pound;13.1 million cut from the Scottish Government, it said.In addition, the council faces inflation totalling &pound;8.6 million and unavoidable costs of &pound;7 million. The council also intends to make a contribution to reserves of &pound;3 million.The required savings are reduced by the ongoing effect of decisions in previous years, which will save around &pound;2 million, and, although council tax will remain frozen, it expects to see an increase in council tax payments of about &pound;0.8 million.Options to meet the savings target will be brought forward between now and the setting of the council's budget in February.Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: &quot;Everyone understands that the Scottish Government has subjected the people of Glasgow to year after year of disproportionate cuts.&quot;Added to the unfunded council tax freeze which continues to put real pressure on services, it's only as a result of clear political leadership and sound financial planning that we've survived the last few years with no really substantial damage to services.&quot;Tough as they are, we will meet next year's challenges, however the Scottish Government has saved the really big cuts for the two or three years after 2015.&quot;It's not good enough for them to continue to pretend that everything's fine; we're going to need to hear some big ideas from them and we're going to need to hear them soon.&quot;
