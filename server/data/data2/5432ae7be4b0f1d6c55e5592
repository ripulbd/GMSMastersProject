Rangers fans call for action plan to save club A high-profile Rangers fans group has called on supporters to create an action plan which will save the crisis-hit club.Frustrated fans have been left exasperated by the latest twists in long-running Rangers saga and will meet tomorrow to lay down their plans for the future.The Sons of Struth group, which has threatened a boycott unless controversial director Sandy Easdale is removed, organised the summit to take place at the Hilton Grosvenor Hotel at 7pm.Organisers said a guest was due to address the meeting, but remained tight-lipped about the identity of the speaker.Emotions at the meeting are sure to run high after the news that billionaire Mike Ashley has strengthened his power base at Rangers.Fans' groups have strongly criticised the Newcastle United owner for paying 20p a share through two intermediaries for the purchase, rather than spend the same amount on the recent open offer aimed at raising &pound;3.6million.It was confirmed last week that he bought 4.26m in shares from Rangers International Football Club plc, more than doubling his stake.The purchase makes him the second biggest stakeholder in the club, behind investment group Laxey Partners.A statement from Sons of Struth said: &quot;The public meeting is for all fans concerned with recent events at our club and who wish to explore possible actions available to the fans.&quot;The meeting comes as Sons of Struth released details of a poll of their members as tensions between the Light Blue legions and the Rangers hierarchy continue to escalate.Sons of Struth have reiterated calls for Mr Easdale to be sacked from the Rangers Football Board and have threatened to boycott his Greenock-based bus company in a bid to force through change.In their poll, 99% of members wanted Easdale out of Ibrox, 92% backed action against McGill's and 89% were supportive of boycotts at Ibrox.Craig Houston, of the Sons of Struth, said: &quot;Our belief is that Sandy Easdale is an obstacle to future outside investment.&quot;Sandy Easdale has been heard to claim that if the Rangers support do not want him at Ibrox he would leave.&quot;We would ask him to take the hint and go.&quot;
