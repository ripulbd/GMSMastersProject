Actor Martin Compston backing our food bank drive SCOTTISH actor Martin Compston is backing the Evening Times' Food for Thought campaign.The Line of Duty and The Wee Man star has thrown his weight behind the cause to make sure no one in Glasgow and the surrounding areas goes hungry.Martin, who has been filming in the city, including with veteran actor Robert Carlyle on his project The Legend of Barney Thomson, said we must support the people who have no other choice but to access food banks.The 30-year-old from Greenock said: &quot;It's shameful that this is happening in Scotland in this day and age.&quot;People have come up to me to tell me they're struggling.&quot;The working class are turning into the lower class because they can't afford to eat, they can't afford anything.&quot;It's happening in Glasgow and it shouldn't be.&quot;I think it's sad that we have to have food banks but while we have them we have to do everything we can to support them.&quot;As we reported on Saturday, the number of people accessing city food banks has more than doubled in a year.Last month a total of 1215 desperate people turned to Trussell Trust food banks, compared to 566 the previous August.We are calling for a more coordinated approach, and we are trying to raise awareness of the good work done by individuals who give their time to support those in need.The aim is to make sure no one is any doubt of where or how to seek help if they are struggling to put meals on the table.Martin, who is currently taking a break from filming to visit his partner in Los Angeles, joins city institutions, including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow Housing Association, Rangers Football Club, Partick Thistle and the Glasgow Tigers Speedway Team, who have pledged to help out.Other backers include comedian Janey Godley and entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter.Martin applauded the George Square food drives, who sprung up in the wake of the referendum outcome.Organisers Andrew and Darren Carnegie, who run Glasgow's Needy, have collected tens of thousands of pounds worth of food. Martin said: &quot;They're doing a fantastic job.&quot;rachel.loxton@ eveningtimes.co.uk
