FORMER Rangers commercial director Imran Ahmad has  returned to court for a third time in a bid to have &pound;620,000 frozen in the club’s account. 

Lawyers acting for Mr Ahmad claim he is owed a &pound;500,000 bonus for the time he spent working at the Championship side. And despite failing on two previous occasions to have the cash ring-fenced, his lawyers returned to the Court of Session yesterday to try again. 
His advocate, Kenny McBrearty QC, told judge Lord Stewart that Mr Ahmad was concerned about the current state of the club’s finances and was worried by the potential prospect of Rangers becoming insolvent. 
Mr McBrearty said if Mr Ahmad was awarded the &pound;500,000 in the months to come, he would be concerned Rangers would not be able to pay him the sum. Mr McBrearty said that Rangers had sold 23,000 season tickets. Club bosses sold 15,000 more last season. 
Mr McBrearty said the Rangers board’s recent plans to sell shares in the side may only provide a temporary solution to the club’s allegedly poor financial position. 
Mr Ahmad claims the &pound;500,000 is owed to him from negotiating financial deals for the club. The remaining &pound;120,000 he wants ring-fenced is to cover legal expenses. 
Lord Stewart continued the case until tomorrow when lawyers for Rangers will address the court.
