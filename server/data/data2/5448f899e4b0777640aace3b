Fake snake on a street: terrified woman calls SSPCA to report toy reptile A terrified woman called the Scottish SPCA after finding a stray snake, only to discover it was made of rubber.Scotland's animal welfare charity was alerted on October 10 after a member of the public spotted the two and a half foot long creature on Glasgow's Claremont Street.When Senior Inspector Billy Linton arrived he was amused to find a toy snake.Billy said, &quot;The woman had put a cardboard box over the 'snake' to contain it and I lifted it with caution as I expected the snake to be moving. However, I soon realised it was made of rubber.&quot;The toy is quite lifelike so I can understand why the woman was fooled.She genuinely thought it was real and was very frightened.&quot;Many of the incidents I attend involve injured and neglected animals, so this was a bit of light hearted relief and it certainly put a smile on my face.&quot;While this particular rescue turned out to be a false alarm, we'd still always encourage anyone with concerns for an animal to contact us.&quot;Anyone who discovers an injured or distressed animal should call the charity's animal helpline on 03000 999 999.
