Kids cue up to pocket free snooker sessions YOUNGSTERS are getting a chance to hone their cueing skills with a series of free snooker sessions.Snooker clubs in Glasgow are offering budding John Higginses or Stephen Hendrys the chance to hit the green baize.The Ball Room chain is giving children and under-18s the opportunity to play snooker for free at their halls in the South Side and Bellshill every day until 7pm.During the week, boys and girls from across the city are now packing out the snooker clubs after school to play a couple of frames with their friends.The Ball Room chain, which is owned by Gennaro Cortellessa and managed by his sister Jennifer Cortellessa, originally introduced this idea at their snooker halls in Edinburgh during the summer.They made the move because they had become concerned by the lack of youth interest in the sport.And after the success in the capital they decided to expand it to the Glasgow snooker clubs.Mr Cortellessa said: &quot;I feel the sport is really dying in this country - we used to produce the best world champions up until recently.&quot;Some snooker clubs have closed down in Scotland and many have been forced to drastically put up prices due to higher running costs.&quot;It also doesn't help that there hasn't been much investment put back into clubs by current owners.&quot;Youths are choosing to go up town or to newer complexes, such as cinemas and &shy;bowling centres, since they are seen as cooler places to be.&quot;Since opening up the free sessions in Glasgow, he has seen people more take up the sport.He said: &quot;We have seen a massive responsive from kids but especially from parents, since they're happy that they have somewhere they can bring their kids and get involved with a sport.&quot;Gennaro believes this initiative can help produce the Scotland's next snooker superstar.He said: &quot;Scotland can once again be known as the top country in producing professional, talented and eventually wealthy sports personalities.&quot;We feel that kids and parents have no excuses not to at least try the sport and see if the kids enjoy it or not.&quot;What have they got to lose really?&quot;You never know, someone's son or daughter might be the next Stephen Hendry, earning millions.&quot;kris.gunn@eveningtimes.co.uk
