MSP slams lack of info on fugitive ONE of Scotland's most experienced crime-busters today said more information about wanted fugitives should be given to the public.Labour justice spokesman Graeme Pearson's comments came as a massive manhunt continued for Jonathan Kelly, 34.Mr Pearson slammed the decision to release &quot;scant&quot; details about the case, saying it could jeopardise the search.Glasgow remains at the centre of the manhunt for Kelly, who was recently freed from Low Moss Prison, Bishopbriggs. A team of around 10 officers are working to establish new lines of inquiry and trace Kelly.Just days ago, armed police, acting on intelligence, swooped on a Glasgow street.But following a seven-hour operation, Kelly was nowhere to be found.Mr Pearson said: &quot;Events in Govanhill reveal the heightened risks occasioned by this prisoner being free among us.&quot;From what we know thus far, the authorities were highly concerned about his release before he disappeared.&quot;Police Scotland must be more forthcoming with information in these circumstances.&quot;The public are entitled to access the photograph, name, nature of previous criminality and known haunts at the earliest.&quot;Too often releases of information are scant and lacking in the details designed to enable a prisoner's quick return to prison without incident.&quot;I wish the police well with their efforts.&quot;Police Scotland have issued several statements about Kelly, including a picture of him, urging the public to be aware of him and report any sightings.It is understood Kelly has &quot;associates&quot; across the Glasgow area - many of whom he may have met during his time in prison.While in prison, Kelly wrote to campaign group Miscarriages of Justice UK about his life of violence.He had a reputation for violence in prison, and a long record, including slashings and stabbings.People have been warned not to approach him and to call 999 if he is spotted.Detective Inspector Ian Hylands said: &quot;I would appeal to Kelly to give himself up and contact police with a view to handing himself in.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
