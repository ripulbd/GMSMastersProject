THE A83 landslide at the Rest and Be Thankful pass in Argyll yesterday was the biggest recorded, with car-size boulders among more than 2,000 tonnes of debris tumbling down the hillside, trunk road firm BEAR Scotland has revealed.


The main route between Glasgow and Kintyre is due to re-open tomorrow afternoon after being cleared, with traffic currently switched to a diversion via the parallel Old Military Road.

Three specialist excavators are making “good progress” in clearing both the road and 1,200 tonnes of debris caught by debris fencing on the hillside above, with a total of 1,500 tonnes removed so far.
The fencing will be removed as part of the work, which felt the “full force” of the landslide, BEAR Scotland said.
The previous worst landslip was in September 2009 when some 1,000 tonnes fell, with yesterday’s closure the 11th in three years.
A BEAR Scotland spokeswoman said: “It is expected that the A83 will re-open to motorists before tomorrow’s evening peak.
“As a precautionary measure, the road will re-open under temporary traffic signal control.”
