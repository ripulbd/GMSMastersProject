SERIOUS incidents in schools in Glasgow's South Side have soared in just one year. Serious 'incidents' rise across Glasgow schools SERIOUS incidents in schools in Glasgow's South Side have soared in just one year.New figures from Glasgow City Council show serious incidents - events that could lead to a child being permanently excluded - in the south of the city have risen by 77%.Across the city, numbers are up are up nearly 20%.&quot;Serious incidents&quot; can include drug dealing, carrying a weapon to school or assaulting a teacher or pupil.The most serious sanction a school has is to remove or exclude a child permanently.The number of serious incidents in schools have been reducing since 2011 but are up this year in the North West and South of the city.For the years 2012/13, there were 66 serious incidents in the North East of Glasgow, dropping to 55 for 2013/14.But the number for the North West has spiked over the same period from 39 to 48.And in the South of the city the number has rocketed from 36 to 64 - up 77%.However, figures also show attendances at primary, secondary and Additional Support for Learning (ASL) schools is up across the board.The Scottish Government stopped publishing attendance data some years ago and so there is no nationwide comparison.But in Glasgow the number of days lost to pupil absence is on the decline.Councillor Stephen Curran, Executive Member for Education and Young People, said: &quot;With increased attendance, reductions in exclusions and attainment across the board at an all time high, Glasgow is constantly driving up standards in education and our young people are really starting to reap the benefits. If our children are not in school then they are not learning.&quot;Parents can be assured of our commitment to build on this success story and continue to raise standards across the city.&quot;Attendance in ASL schools is the lowest in the city, at 90.1%, compared to 91.5% for secondaries and 94.1% for primaries.Education bosses say children with additional needs tend to have lower attendance rates due to illness.Totals are also affected by the number of children who have left mainstream education and are being taught in specialist provision.Exclusions are decreasing, with a 15% reduction in exclusion incidents across all three sectors from last year.Since 2006/2007, when exclusions were at their highest levels, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of pupils banned from schools.The report shows the greatest success at reducing exclusions is at secondary level.Teachers use positive behaviour approaches, such as restorative justice techniques, and look at what is causing a pupil's poor behaviour.Broken down month by month, the figures show that exclusions are more likely in November and March.A small number of pupils are being excluded from school more than once.Two thirds of excluded primary and secondary pupils are taken out of school once, but others have found themselves excluded repeatedly- some more than seven times.Education bosses said although it is positive that exclusions are falling, too many pupils are still being repeatedly excluded.On average, secondary pupils are excluded for 2.2 days per incident, although this varies between schools, with one excluding pupils for six days on average.The report states exclusion should only be used when there are no other options, as it can be hard for children to reintegrate .catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk
