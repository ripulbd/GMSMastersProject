BOGUS cops are recruiting pensioners as "undercover agents" in an elaborate scam, a fraud expert has warned. Fake police target OAPs with 'forged' cash scam BOGUS cops are recruiting pensioners as "undercover agents" in an elaborate scam, a fraud expert has warned.Unsuspecting OAPs are duped into withdrawing their savings from banks by fraudsters posing as police officers.Tony Blake, from a nationwide anti-fraud unit, told the Evening Times about a 90-year-old woman who was cruelly conned out of thousands of pounds.He said: &quot;This scam involves elderly and vulnerable people being called or visited at home by a criminal posing as a police officer.&quot;They tell the victim that the staff at their local bank are handing out counterfeit money when people make withdrawals.&quot;They say they need the victim to go into the branch undercover and withdraw money.&quot;The victim is then instructed to hand the money over to the 'police' so they can 'check it'.&quot;Some people might find it hard to believe, but these people are convincing, and they specifically pick people who are elderly, isolated and vulnerable.&quot;Pensioners are being conned out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.&quot;Organised gangs are believed to be using the scam to steal thousands from elderly people across the country.Mr Blake, a Fraud Prevention Officer with the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU), is hosting a seminar in Glasgow today, aimed at cracking down on conmen.He said: &quot;Unfortunately, my job is telling people not to trust others, but it is vital you make sure you know who you are really talking to.&quot;While fraudsters' tactics vary from scam to scam, the one common thread is that they impersonate trusted organisations.&quot;Another scam is where criminals posing as police get the victim to buy watches or jewellery with their own cash, to 'prove' the staff at the shop are selling counterfeit goods.&quot;These callous criminals rely on their victims' good nature in responding to a legitimate sounding request - do not let them.&quot;People are not always who they say they are.&quot;Mr Blake will be joined by Police Scotland officers as he launches the Hang Up On Fraud campaign at The Glasgow 50+ Show at the SECC today.He said: &quot;The message I need to get across to people is, just because someone claims they are from your bank, police or another trusted organisation, does not mean they are.&quot;It's also important that people know what to do when they are targeted by cold callers - regardless of who they say they represent or what they are offering.&quot;Be very suspicious of any cold call requesting your personal information or pushing you to take urgent action.&quot;If you are at all suspicious just hang up the phone and report the call to your bank or Action Fraud.&quot;The DCPCU has a national remit, and comprises of expert officers from the Met and City of London forces.They work alongside colleagues from across the country, including Police Scotland, to combat bank, phone and online fraud.Since the unit was formed in 2002, officers have stopped around &pound;450million being conned from UK residents.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
