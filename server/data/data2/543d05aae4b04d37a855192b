Comedian is looking forward to his first visit to Hamilton. HA HA Hamilton: C4 star Mark Dolan is looking to deliver a 'personal touch' to Hamilton show - Daily Record Kicking off this year’s comedy festival in Hamilton is comedian Mark Dolan.
The star of Channel 4’s Balls of Steel can’t wait to visit the town after coming north for a run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
He said: “I adore Scotland. I went to university in Scotland and of course I have just finished the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. I also had an aunt who lived in Glasgow. But I have never been to Hamilton so I will have to do my research before I embark on the town, but I am really looking forward to my visit.”
Mark says the Ha Ha Hamilton event is a great thing for the town.
He said: “I think it is a really clever idea. Bringing comedy to smaller towns is such a good idea.
“It makes it more personal. Hopefully I will be able to bring something to it that the people of Hamilton can enjoy.”
Mark made an appearance with one of the headliners of the festival, Bobby Davro, last year.
He said: “I met Bobby Davro last year and he was great. Bringing the likes of him and Roy Walker to the town will be something not to be missed.”
The funnyman’s show is called Mark Dolan Changes The World. “There certainly has been a lot of atmosphere for change recently with the referendum vote in Scotland and the general election coming up next year,” he said.
“I’ll talk about how I would stop people taking selfies and I’d make social media less annoying. I’d make it mandatory that someone’s profile picture shows them for who they actually are and not be, in some cases, an animal.
“I’ve been workshopping my act on the Fringe, giving me a chance to make it better each day, so Hamilton will get the end product.”
Tickets for Mark’s show, at 8pm on Friday, October 17 at Hamilton Palace, are priced &pound;12.50.
