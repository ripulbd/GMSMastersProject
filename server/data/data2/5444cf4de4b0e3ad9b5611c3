I want to go out there as I am.&quot;She said she wanted her autobiography to be &quot;uplifting&quot;, adding: &quot;I wrote the book for everybody out there.&quot;It's not supposed to be an embarrassing account of me having terminal cancer.&quot;I wanted to write it for everybody who is given that curveball and say of course there are no answers but, if you can, take it and make it positive and talk about dying.&quot;If two people read this book and think 'Actually, that's how I feel and I'm not on my own', then I'll have done something half decent.&quot;Bellingham, who took part in the 2009 series of Strictly Come Dancing, was also a panellist on ITV show Loose Women in recent years.She filmed a special farewell episode of the ITV show, which is yet to air, in which she received a standing ovation.She also presented a number of other programmes, following an acting career which saw her star in dramas such as At Home With The Braithwaites and The Bill.Stars paid tribute to Bellingham on Twitter.Actor Simon Pegg, who starred with the actress in 1990s TV show Faith In The Future, said: &quot;Lynda Bellingham, a gorgeous, brassy, funny, generous, talented human being.

Honest, generous, kind, courageous, intelligent, thoughtful, all of those things.&quot;Fitness guru Diana Moran - also known as the Green Goddess - described Bellingham as the &quot;ultimate professional&quot;.She told BBC News: &quot;She was a lovely, lovely woman altogether. She'd experienced a lot in life.&quot;She had her priorities right and I admired her enormously.&quot;Bellingham's Loose Women co-presenter Nadia Sawalha, who also appeared with the actress in the Oxo adverts, paid tribute to a &quot;brilliant actress.&quot;She told ITV show Lorraine: &quot;We're just all heartbroken because her real, her last wish was that she would spend this Christmas with her family.&quot;Anyone that knew Lynda and knew her well, knew that she was this absolute live wire. She would come into a room and light the place up. Everybody loved her.&quot;She got me my first ever job on the Oxo ads... I played her son's girlfriend in it and then we worked together on (TV series) Second Thoughts. She played my sister's mum.&quot;And we all absolutely adored her because she was, in that true sense of the word, the actress. She loved it, she had none of that pretending that she didn't. She'd go, 'Darling, the adoration, I adore it! The audience!' That was really her, she had no shame with that.&quot;She was a brilliant actress and she moved me to tears many times. She will be so, so sorely missed by so many of us.&quot;She said that Bellingham told her fellow Loose Women panellists: &quot;'Please when I'm gone, have a big party for me and have a dance' and that's Lynda though and through.&quot;Loose Women issued a statement on its Twitter feed, saying: &quot;Our thoughts go to #lyndabellingham's family at this incredibly sad time and to all those whose lives she touched so deeply, as she did ours.&quot;Belllingham's co-star from All Creatures Great And Small Christopher Timothy said: &quot;She was a life-force. She was funny, she was loyal, she was talented, that's without doubt. She was a great mum, she was a real friend and on-set she was 'one of the boys' really.&quot;She was naughty and funny. We've all been expecting it but it's so unjust that she didn't make her last Christmas as was her intention.&quot;He told BBC Breakfast: &quot;It's extraordinary... because her honesty and her up-frontness was exactly what one knew and exactly what one expected, but it made it more painful.&quot;It's this thing where people state things as they are rather than trying to colour it in any way, it's so much more moving and painful.&quot;
