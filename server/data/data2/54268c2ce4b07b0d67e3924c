The tallest wind turbines ever approved on the UK mainland are to form part of a new project in South Lanarkshire. Huge turbines for Middle Muir wind farm near Crawfordjohn The tallest wind turbines ever approved on the UK mainland are to form part of a new project in South Lanarkshire.
Seven of the 15 turbines in the Middle Muir facility, just over a mile from Crawfordjohn, will stand 152m high.
The wind farm, which has been approved by the Scottish government, will have the potential to generate up to 60MW of electricity, enough for 28,000 homes.
Developer Banks Renewables estimates that 25 to 50 jobs will be created from construction to decommissioning. 
Two more turbines were turned down to mitigate landscape and visual impacts.
Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: &quot;The Middle Muir wind farm will create jobs both in its construction, and during its lifetime. 
&quot;In addition it will bring &pound;7.2m of community benefit funding for local communities and will also be able to produce enough electricity to power almost 28,000 homes. 
&quot;Once it is up and running the wind farm will help reduce carbon emissions from our electricity generation, aiding Scotland's work to tackle climate change.&quot;
