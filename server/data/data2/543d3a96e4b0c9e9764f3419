THEY have been forced to flee their own countries after suffering torture, violence and brutality. Glasgow is 'Uniting Nations' to help refugee families THEY have been forced to flee their own countries after suffering torture, violence and brutality.But when asylum seekers come to Scotland to seek safety, they are fearful of police and unable to move forward. RACHEL LOXTON met a group who hope their scheme can help unite different communities across the country.VOLUNTEERS bringing together different ethnic communities in Glasgow are calling for the scheme to go nationwide.The coordinators of Uniting Nations in Scotland (UNIS) say the group is both helping to break down barriers faced by refugees and tackling racism.The group was launched in Glasgow last year, after an influx of refugees from war-ravaged Syria arrived in the city.The UNIS group has grown and now has members with different backgrounds and nationalities - from Morocco to Sudan.They regularly meet with police constable Dario D'Andrea, who has been working to gain their trust.Other volunteers include Evening Times Community Champion Ahlam Souidi, who came to the city as a refugee from Algeria 13 years ago, and Clare Bird, from North Glasgow-based housing association ng homes.They meet regularly with refugees to help them fill out paperwork and to discuss their cases.These events are also social occasions, where families and individuals can meet up and share experiences. . On a Friday night, in a meeting room at Glasgow's Napiershall Street Centre, around 25 people are chattering round a table.Ahlam, who works for the Maryhill Integration Network and is one of the group's founders, says she wants to &quot;empower members&quot;.She says: &quot;The idea was to let them talk about what's on their mind, talk about their experiences.&quot;It's about empowering people... to take up the responsibilities, to build their chances.&quot;Ahlam says members of the group &quot;come with no confidence&quot; and are wary of the authorities.She says: &quot;They have been tortured, they have been abused by police and the army. Their life is on hold. It is so difficult when it comes to trust.&quot;They don't trust anyone. But they see Dario now and they realise that a uniform does not mean they have anything to fear.&quot;Ahlam wants to see groups like this all over the country.She says: &quot;I was in their shoes in the past. I understand what it is like being in another country where you don't know the language.&quot;PC D'Andrea, who previously worked with refugees in Sighthill, liaises with the city's community officers.He says: &quot;With refugees, you're starting with a low level of trust.&quot;You hear stories about their own countries, where they've been abused by the police, they've had money taken off them.&quot;We've got to make sure they have confidence in us.&quot;Recently, PC D'Andrea arranged for some Syrian refugees to visit Maryhill Police Office, to &quot;come behind the scenes&quot;.He says: &quot;They get to see what we do. They see we have CCTV, they see we have a complaints procedure: things that are totally new to them.&quot;Syrian refugee Munir Emkideh, who came to Glasgow around two years ago, is chairman of the group.The 49-year-old dad-offour was a solicitor in his home town of Jasim, in southern Syria, but is now struggling to find work.He says he loves Glasgow, because it has been so welcoming.He says: &quot;Everyone is friendly here.&quot;My wife and my children like it here too.&quot;Where I came from, you never knew when air strikes would happen, it was dangerous.&quot;Sihab Lakouahi, 27, from Morocco, came to Glasgow in 2013.She says: &quot;It is very friendly when you come to Glasgow. I've managed to make more friends at this g roup.&quot;Hana Renad, 36, was forced to flee Eritrea, in Africa, after being tortured and raped by police.She is without one of her sons, who is being looked after by family in Greece.Through her friend, acting as a translator, Hana says: &quot;I am doing everything I can to get him back.&quot;Volunteer Clare Bird says it is important to see people as &quot;more than a number&quot;.She says: &quot;They're a solicitor or a doctor or a teacher.&quot;That's why we've been integrating Scottish people, so they can see that refugees are just like us. They've just been through terrible things.&quot;rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk
