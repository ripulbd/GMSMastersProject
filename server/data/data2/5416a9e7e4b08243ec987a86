A PETITION has been launched to save the Glasgow Men's 10K from being axed. Petition sent to Salmond in bid to save Men's 10K A PETITION has been launched to save the Glasgow Men's 10K from being axed.Scotland's only dedicated 10K for men was first held in 2006 and went from strength to strength.But the race, which was held in Bellahouston Park and raised thousands of pounds each year for charity, had been under threat for some time due to cash problems and it was recently announced it would no longer be held.However, a petition addressed to First Minister Alex Salmond has now been drawn up in a final attempt to save the event.A spokesman for The Men's Health Forum, which organises the event, said it had approached almost 200 different organisations with sponsorship options, but no-one was in the position to make a financial commitment.He added: &quot;It is sad this event will no longer inspire thousands of men to take action to improve their lifestyle.&quot;
