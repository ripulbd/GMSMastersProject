THE Glasgow student who enjoyed a privileged upbringing, travelled to Syria in 2013 and married a Jihadist fighter. Private schoolgirl turned Jihadist war bride Aqsa Mahmood told her distraught mum and dad she wants to be a martyr - Daily Record A JIHADIST bride who fled Glasgow to marry an Islamic State fighter told her heartbroken parents: “I want to be a martyr.”
Aqsa Mahmood’s last words to her mum Khalida, 43, and dad Muzaffar, 51, were revealed as they spoke for the first time of the moment she travelled to Syria.
The 20-year-old Glaswegian cut short her university degree in November 2013 to live with extremists in the war-torn country.
Her hotelier dad said: “Her message was, ‘I will see you on the day of judgment. I will take you to heaven. I will hold your hand’.
“That’s what she said, ‘I want to be a martyr’.”
Aqsa, from Dumbreck, became obsessed with “helping” in Syria after witnessing war break out last year.
After arriving in the warzone, she called on others to repeat brutal atrocities in Britain – including the slaying of soldier Lee Rigby.
Aqsa sent her father a message soon after saying that she had married an Islamic State fighter.
Muzaffar said: “We used to tell her, ‘This is not Islam’. They are doing wrong things which we don’t approve of. Obviously, no Muslim approves this.”
Dozens of disillusioned British jihadists are said to on the run from the Islamic State in Syria.
