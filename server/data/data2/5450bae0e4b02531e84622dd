POLICE are taking on the role of "baddies" to protect vulnerable pensioners from ruthless conmen. Cops play robbers in OAP project POLICE are taking on the role of "baddies" to protect vulnerable pensioners from ruthless conmen.Tactics, including role-playing exercises with officers, are being used as police wage war on the scourge of bogus callers and pickpockets.Elderly women have also been given small bells to attach to their handbags or purses to warn them if someone is trying to grab their money.As officers point out, there can be a spike in bogus caller incidents in the winter months due to increased hours of darkness.It is a crime which has a profound affect on its victims, and often sparks a serious decline in health.Constable Calum Yuill said: &quot;Unfortunately, there are people out there who will use the increased hours of darkness to target those they deem vulnerable.&quot;Being a victim of crime is extremely traumatic and these presentations will provide relevant advice and support for local people.&quot;This will result in increased awareness and confidence should anyone try to dupe them, helping prevent them becoming a victim of crime.&quot;Hundreds of elderly people across Glasgow will take part in the initiative, but efforts have been particularly focused in Drumchapel, which is a known target for conmen.Senior officers said role-playing exercises and presentations aim to &quot;develop and enhance people's confidence, empowering them to protect themselves&quot;.It is understood police will take on the roles of bogus callers to simulate scenarios in the hope of elderly people identifying fraudsters and to deter crooks.Purse snatchers are also being targeted due to an increase in the number of &quot;bag dips&quot; during the winter.The idea is to attach the bell to the bag zip then if a thief tries to put their hand inside, the bell rings. If attached to a purse in a bag, the bell will ring if the purse moves.Police Scotland is behind the scheme, which has seen hundreds of the mini bells distributed to pensioners across the city as part of an information pack.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
