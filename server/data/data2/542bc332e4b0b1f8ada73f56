CONTROVERSIAL plans for a new city centre student flats have been approved by the council. Anger at go ahead for student flats CONTROVERSIAL plans for a new city centre student flats have been approved by the council.The scheme, by Glasgow firm Inehaze, to develop new flats in Garnethill angered residents, who lodged 43 objections to the planning application.Despite their concerns, approval was granted by the city council for the planned seven-storey development on the north side of Renfrew Street.The site is in the Central Conservation Area, near Glasgow Film Theatre and St Aloysius Church, and is currently used as a car park for a nearby multi-cultural centre.Community Councillor Bill Beckett said locals intend to keep fighting the plans and are considering taking legal action if they go ahead.Mr Beckett said: &quot;The car park houses up to 10 vehicles and that's getting taken away and there are several spaces being taken away from the underground car park at Fleming House, next door.&quot;Having this happen is creating a big problem for Garnethill, as we're limited to the number of spaces we have.&quot;Along with the reduction in car parking spaces, residents also fear an increase in anti-social behaviour.The planning report states the block will provide 85 rooms in clusters of four, five, six and seven-bedrooms, with each having a kitchen/living room.Mr Beckett said: &quot;It's a residential area and this will mean it will be noisy with students coming back at night time, under the influence of alcohol, causing disturbances and making noise, slamming doors, taxis honking horns etc.&quot;It's going to be a total nightmare for the residents, particularly for the elderly and those who have young children.&quot;In addition, the size of the premises is going to take away sunlight from nearby gardens and houses.&quot;In the summer time people will be sitting in the shade rather than the sun.&quot;I think it's atrocious.&quot;Permission has been granted by the planning departments and we are not accepting it, we will fight it.&quot;Residents also submitted complaints about the block not being in-keeping with other surrounding buildings.A council spokesman said: &quot;This application for student accommodation, car parking and a retail unit was approved by the planning applications committee on September 16.&quot;hannah.rodger@ eveningtimes.co.uk
