Now, bank bosses have offered to match donations for Moira's Run up to &pound;3500.And staff at the branch will also be taking part in the 5k at the park, week on Sunday, which will be a celebration of Moira's life.Moira's mum Bea, 73, said she has been overwhelmed by the generosity of the Queen's Park community and local businesses.The retired English teacher, who lives in Weston, Staffordshire, said: &quot;I am just amazed at what is going on. It is so great that Santander is matching donations up to &pound;3500 and making folk even more determined to raise what they can.&quot;The Santander team in Victoria Road are taking part in the run. I am overwhelmed by it all. I don't know these wonderful people but hope I get a chance to say thank you to everyone.&quot;Bea, along with members of the Police Scotland Violence Reduction team and other volunteers, has thrown herself into organising the charity run.Stephen Bremner, branch manager at Santander in Victoria Road, said he hoped the bank would to be involved in the run every year.He said: &quot;When I was approached by the police Violence Reduction team, I thought it was so relevant that we needed to get involved.&quot;Moira died in the park, which is only a stone's throw away from our branch, and we felt really strongly that we had to help out in any way we could.&quot;We will match the donations up to &pound;3500 and also a team of five from the branch will be taking part in the run.&quot;We are very involved in the local community. This is a really good cause and such a tragic story. We would like to support the charity run annually.&quot;Last month, Bea told the Evening Times of her heartache at losing her beloved daughter Moira and how she is still haunted by the horror of her &quot;vile and barbaric&quot; rape and torture after being abducted yards from her home in May, 2008.Slovakian Marek Harcar was later jailed for life for her murderThe run will help raise cash for The Moira Fund, set up by Bea to help people whose relatives are murdered.To sign up for the run, visit: www.moirasrun.co.ukjanice.burns@ eveningtimes.co.uk
