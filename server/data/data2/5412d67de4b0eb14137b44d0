Bid to find V.C. hero's family GLASGOW Lord Provost Sadie Docherty has launched an urgent appeal for the family of a war hero to get in touch.Captain Harry Ranken, who was born in Maryhill, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery in France during the First World War.The doctor died on Septem-ber 24, 1914 five days after being injured as he was treating wounded colleagues.Last year, the UK govern-ment announced every First World War recipient of the honour would have a paving stone unveiled to mark their act of valour.As nobody from the Ranken family came forward, the city council decided to place the stone at Glasgow University, where Harry's parents Henry and Helen Ranken placed a memorial to their eldest son.Mrs Docherty has now issued a final appeal for any of Harry's family to get in touch. He was unmarried but his brother Alan had three daughters born in the 1920s - Elizabeth, Helen and Mary.Mrs Docherty said: &quot;It would be lovely if any of his brother's family came forward.&quot;A service will also be held at the university to mark the 100th anniversary of his death.Members of the Captain's family who want to attend should call the city council on 0141 287 2000.
