Office is brought into 21st century A HISTORIC Glasgow office block which was built in the year Britain elected its first Labour government has been brought into the 21st century.The Culzean Build-ing has undergone major renovations which have included the introduction of air conditioning as part of a &pound;1.9million facelift and the owners have now launched a search for new tenants.The detached seven-storey building - including basement and ground floor - is in Renfield Street, near St Vincent Street.It was called Culzean House until bought by the Unilever Pension Fund in 2006 for &pound;9.2million after stiff competition from six other bidders keen to buy the city centre Grade B property.The Culzean Build-ing was built in 1924 -the year Ramsay MacDonald formed the first Labour govern-ment and when the Russians renamed the city of St Petersburg as Leningrad.Now almost half of the office space -almost 19,000sq ft - is available to lease following the upgrade which has included a new entrance with a service video system, new toilets and showers on every floor, as well as a cycle rack facility and car parking in the basement.The new-look office block is managed on behalf of the pension fund by CBRE Global Investors.Its official Hannah Marshall said: &quot;The refurbishment of The Culzean Building marks our commit-ment to Glasgow's commercial property market and to the provision of good quality space in a bid to attract occupiers and jobs to the city.&quot;She added: &quot;We are quoting competitive rents from &pound;17.50 per sq ft exclusive of car parking.&quot;gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
