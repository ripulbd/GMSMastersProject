Peru drug mule Melissa Reid to feature in adverts A Scottish woman who was caught with &pound;1.5m of cocaine in Peru is to feature in adverts warning about the dangers of drug smuggling.
Melissa Reid, 21, was jailed for six years and eight months by a Peruvian court last year.
Reid and co-accused Michaella McCollum are serving their sentences at a prison in Lima.
She will feature in a Foreign Office campaign aimed at preventing other young people becoming drugs mules.
The campaign is expected to include TV adverts, posters and social media advertising.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office told the Scottish Mail on Sunday newspaper: &quot;The focus of the campaign is to reduce the number of drug related consular cases and raise awareness of the risks.&quot;
Reid, 21, from Lenzie in East Dunbartonshire, and McCollum, 20, from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were arrested at Lima airport in August of last year with 11kg (24lb) of cocaine.
The pair had originally claimed to have been kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to smuggle food packets filled with the drug from Peru to Ibiza.
But they later admitted they had been paid by a criminal gang to carry the cocaine in their luggage.
Both women are expected to be transferred from to Peru prisons to prisons in the UK, where they will serve the remainder of their sentences.
