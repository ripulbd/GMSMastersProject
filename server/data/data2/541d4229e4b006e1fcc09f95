We need to reflect on why the offer we were making wasn't acceptable.&quot;&quot;I have already had a discussion with council leader Gordon Matheson about how we need to have a gathering of Glasgow's MPs, MSPs and councillors to co-ordinate a joint political approach.&quot;He agreed the focus would be on &quot;battling back&quot; ahead of next year's national vote.Dr Karly Kehoe, a senior lecturer in history at Caledonian University, claimed the Glasgow result shows people want change.She said: &quot;Labour is in disarray. Indeed Labour has been in disarray this whole campaign.&quot;They lost Glasgow and it is humiliating for them because Glasgow is meant to be Labour bedrock. They want to ask some important questions about what went wrong.&quot;She said she believed the party had stopped listening to their supporters.Ms Kehoe added: &quot;What this has shown is that people are not happy and want a serious shake up. People are disenchanted and that was what this vote was about.&quot;It is not going to be possible to go back to the way things were.&quot;Labour will have to find a new message because they seem to have lost their core values.&quot;Thomas Lundberg, a politics lecturer at Glasgow University, said the vote could cause problems for Labour in the future.He said: &quot;People are not surprised at the Glasgow vote and that a big working class population would vote Yes. It looked like a lot of Labour voters were going to go over to Yes.&quot;This could be a big problem for Labour because we are seeing the continua-tion of the shift of working class voters to the SNP.&quot;BOB DORIS, Glasgow SNP MSP, was jubilant to see they had a &quot;clear majority&quot; in Glasgow.He said: &quot;Glasgow is clearly on a move towards independence, thirsting for more than devo max.&quot;Results have been different elsewhere but all you can do is take a look at your own back yard and it's a positive result in Glasgow for the Yes campaign and I'm absolutely delighted. I'm looking forward to getting back on the streets and thanking my constituents in Glasgow for a resounding Yes victory.&quot;In Cathcart, the only city area to hit 80% turnout, the Yes win was by almost 3000 votes.James Dornan SNP MSP said: &quot;The Glasgow result is in-keeping with a lot of working class areas across the county.&quot;It shows a disgust at Labour's close cronyism with the Tories to block independence.&quot;If this is a victory for the No campaign, in Glasgow it is a Pyrrhic victory.&quot;Glasgow voters gave the Yes campaign a strong backing, with 194,779 backing independence, compared to 169,347 for No, 53.5% compared to 46.5%.Many Labour politicians tried to focus on the nation-wide referendum result but some were prepared to admit it had ramifications for the party in the city.Matt Kerr, councillor for Craigton, admitted there was a need to be &quot;honest with ourselves&quot; following the city defeat, and said: &quot;The downside is the Glasgow result.&quot;There are people out there who feel they are not part of society as well as people who fundamentally believe in an independent nation state.&quot;I think what we can take out of this is a renewed level of political engagement.&quot;Hopefully the people who drifted away from Labour during this process will continue to play a part in the political life in this city in future.&quot;Deputy First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon said Glasgow had delivered a message to Labour.She said: &quot;They want change. Every single constituency in Glasgow has voted Yes. Labour's heartlands, or what they used to consider their heartlands, in Glasgow have voted Yes fairly convincingly, so I think there's a hard message in there for the Labour leadership.&quot;
