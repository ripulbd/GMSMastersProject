Mum starts funds drive after losing twin son A MUM who lost one of her twin babies has raised almost £1000 to help raise awareness of the disease which killed her son.Louise Chisholm, 29, told the Evening Times about her nightmare ordeal after finding out her sons Jack and Samuel had twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).The condition, caused by a disorder of the placenta, meant she could lose them both unless she had an emergency procedure.Louise, from Cathkin, was sent to a hospital in Birmingham for intrauterine laser surgery on the placenta &shy;because the operation isn't available in Scotland.But a day after returning from England, she was taken to Glasgow's Princess Royal Hospital where she was told little Samuel had died. However, she still had to carry him in her womb until Jack was born.Convincing herself that doctors were wrong and that she still had two healthy babies was the only way she could cope with her ordeal.She carried her twins for &shy;another eight weeks until she went into labour on September 19, last year, but only Jack survived.Now Louise has just raised &pound;875 by holding a charity night at Harleys Sky Bar in Rutherglen Main Street on September 5.But she's not stopping there and plans a series of charity events, including a sky dive.Louise's aim is raise awareness of the condition and also to help pay travel costs for parents who have to make the journey down south.She said: &quot;I can't thank everyone who supported me and came along to my charity event enough.&quot;This event is a step in the right direction because I want to hold many more events and raise as much as I can to help the neonatal unit at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow raise awareness, pay for equipment and training and help mothers pay for the trip to Birmingham for the surgery.&quot;janice.burns@eveningtimes.co.uk
