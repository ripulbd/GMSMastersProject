&quot;Mind and don't go rugby tackling any kid riding a blue Inspired Skye off there bike! Mine have a pretty specific set up which I will post later. Cheers Danny.&quot;
His post drew outpourings of sympathy on the social media site, with Daniel Druce writing: &quot;That's like stealing Picasso 's paint brush! Sorry to hear dude!&quot; while David McNicol offered some hope, writing: &quot;That is rubbish, on the bright side, they have pinched one of the most photographed bikes about, hopefully they get caught soon.&quot;
MacAskill, from the Isle of Skye, is a professional street trials rider for Inspired Bicycles Ltd.
