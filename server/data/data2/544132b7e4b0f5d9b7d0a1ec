A builder has been jailed for seven years for attempting to murder a man with a machete over a £50 bill. Renfrewshire builder Scott Dominick jailed for murder bid over £50 bill A builder has been jailed for seven years for attempting to murder a man with a machete over a &pound;50 bill.
Scott Dominick, 50, slashed Andrew Palmer's chin because he believed he was not going to be paid.
He had carried out more work on a patio at the home of Mr Palmer's estranged wife in Linwood, Renfrewshire, than was originally agreed. 
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Dominick later told police officers: &quot;I will slash your throats too.&quot;
Dominick had been given an extra &pound;50 by Mrs Palmer but believed her husband was making a fool of him. He thought Mr Palmer was refusing to pay the rest.
He challenged Mr Palmer in Colliers pub in Johnstone in March this year with a machete which he had taken from his house.
In his own evidence, Dominick told the jury Mr Palmer said: &quot;If you're going to do it, do it.&quot;
Mr Palmer said Dominick then told him: &quot;This is for you&quot; and pulled the blade across his chin.
Judge Norman Ritchie QC told Dominick: &quot;I have to deal with you for taking this weapon out, quite deliberately to seek out another man, then to inflict a dreadful injury on him.&quot;
