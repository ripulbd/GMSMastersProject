 Aleksandar Tonev is unavailable for Celtic as the club's appeal against his seven-match suspension has not been submitted on time. 
 Celtic have until Thursday to lodge their appeal. 
 Kris Commons is nearing fitness but wingers James Forrest and Derk Boerrigter remain out. 
 Midfielder Ryan Christie returns to the Inverness squad after serving a one-match suspension but Richie Foran remains a long-term absentee. 
  Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon:  &quot;They have already beaten us this season. 
 &quot;Up there we made a few changes after a European game, this time at home we will be looking to win the game and get our own back for that one. 
 &quot;I think they've done very well. They've been passing the ball a lot more and they are quite an attractive team to watch. 
 &quot;If they come here and look to do that again then there is a possibility they could cause us problems.&quot; 
  Inverness defender Graeme Shinnie:  &quot;It's always good to get a clean sheet against Celtic with the fire power they have got. We were really on top that day [when Inverness beat Celtic 1-0 in August] and the focus was really there. 
 &quot;The clean sheet that day was vital obviously and it gives us a platform to go on and win games. We won that game 1-0 and we have won the last two games 1-0. 
 &quot;As long as we keep clean sheets it gives us a platform to go and grab a goal and if we get that we can defend for the win and try to control the game and pass the ball around, not having to go gung-ho trying to get a goal.&quot;
