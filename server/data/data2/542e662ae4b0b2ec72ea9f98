HE'S on the hunt for Glasgow's hidden treasures. Let's get this show on the road! HE'S on the hunt for Glasgow's hidden treasures.Antique expert Gordon Foster has been involved in the trade for 40 years with his most memorable find coming from the city.Now Gordon is set to cast his eyes over local heirlooms as the Antiques Roadshow heads to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.Gordon said: &quot;We are surprised with something new every time we do the Roadshow but I'm particularly excited about Glasgow for the chance to see silver in the Glasgow style.&quot;With Charles Rennie Mackintosh, at the turn of the 19th century, the style became much more clean and minimalist.&quot;Art really flourished in the city at this time so we don't know what surprises might turn up. I'm very much hoping to see some Celtic style items, particularly from the Iona style of metalwork.&quot;As one of the largest seaports in Britian, valuers from the hit BBC show are looking forward to seeing items from all around the world.They expect to see Kelvingrove flooded with visitors next Thursday when the doors open at 9.30am.The city is also renowned for the Scottish School and the Glasgow School, giving experts the chance to see painting, ceramics, furniture, textiles, jewellery, glass and silver - not to mention the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.Gordon said: &quot;In Glasgow there was a rich merchant class that made its money and had plenty to spend.&quot;Buchanan Street was full of famous jewellers, such as Edwards and Sorleys who made choice items for wealthy customers.&quot;I'm intrigued to see what silver items people have hidden away - from jewellery to tea pots. Even if someone is not sure whether their item has any value or not I would still recommend they bring it along for us to look at.&quot;Gordon's passion for antiques began at a very early age. His mother had an antiques shop in Dunblane and his summers were spent following his parents as they scoured other shops.At the age of 14 he began collecting Wemyss pottery before serving a five-year apprenticeship as an auctioneer in Crieff.An opportunity to join Christie's in Glasgow as a silver specialist arose and Gordon rose through the ranks to become Associate Director then Head of the Silver and Jewellery Department in 1990.In 1998, Gordon set up his own business buying and selling silver.He also advises Scottish museums and institutions on silver and decorative arts.The 50-year-old joined the Antiques Roadshow in 2006 and says anticipating the unexpected is what keeps him interested.His most memorable find is an enamelled brass cross by one of the Glasgow Girls that appeared at a Roadshow in St Andrews in 2011.He said: &quot;It was made for a private family and is a personal religious item so it wasn't of great value but it was a beautiful object, made in the early 20th century and just a real joy to see.&quot;Filming for the 37th series of the show will take place next Thursday. The doors will open at 9.30am and close at 4.30pm and entry is free.Some of Britain's leading antiques and fine arts specialists will be on hand to offer free advice and valuations to visitors.More information can be found at www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums or www.bbc.co.uk/antiquesroadshow
