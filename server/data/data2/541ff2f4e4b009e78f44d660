Yes and No join hands at church service POLITICAL figures from both sides of the Scottish independence debate gathered for a special church service yesterday to promote unity in the wake of the referendum.Around 1000 people gathered for the Church of Scotland event at St Giles' Cathedral on Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile.Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander and Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander were among those present.Better Together leader Alistair Darling, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and former Liberal leader Lord Steel also joined the gathering.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Labour leader Johann Lamont, LibDem leader Willie Rennie and SNP MSP for Shettleston John Mason were also present.After the service Mr Swinney said: &quot;I'm here to make clear the willingness of the Yes campaign to be part of taking the country forward in the light of the referendum.&quot;We shouldn't be fearful of the referendum. The referendum was a democratic debate. I had one vote, everyone else had one vote.&quot;Mr Alexander said: &quot;Today Scotland is still a divided nation and we need to heal those wounds and bind ourselves together.&quot;When I extended the hand of friendship to my good friend John Swinney today I hope that gesture will be replicated around kitchen tables and workplaces and pubs and clubs and school gates in the days ahead, because there are no longer No supporters, there are no longer Yes supporters.&quot;
