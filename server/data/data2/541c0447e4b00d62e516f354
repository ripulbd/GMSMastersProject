A STATUE of Commonwealth Games mascot Clyde is to have a new home at a Glasgow children’s hospital 2014 Clyde statue given to Yorkhill hospital A STATUE of Commonwealth Games mascot Clyde is to have a new home at a Glasgow children’s hospital.

Glasgow 2014 has gifted the life-sized figure to Games volunteers, who were raising funds to bid for the mascot via the official Games Auction.
The volunteers will now be able to donate the money they have raised as well as Clyde himself to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill in Glasgow.
The statue, dressed in the red and grey Games uniform, stood at the entrance to the Glasgow 2014 Uniform and Accreditation Centre (UAC) at the Kelvin Hall.
It was one of 25 located around the city during Glasgow 2014 as part of “Clyde’s Trail”.
Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg said: “The Glasgow 2014 volunteers inspired everyone who experienced the Commonwealth Games with their passion and energy.
“It’s absolutely great that they are passing on their own generous and inspiring Games legacy by helping to put a smile on the faces of children visiting the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
“Clyde was the cheeky, cheery face of Glasgow 2014 created by a child for children and adults alike.
“I’m thrilled that, thanks to our volunteers, he will continue to bring a smile to the faces of Glasgow’s children in need for years to come.”
Clyde will be unveiled at Yorkhill in coming weeks.
One of the statues is being auctioned to raise money for UN children’s charity Unicef while the city council is looking for new homes for the others.
