Woman raped by two men on a canal path in Clydebank - Daily Record POLICE have appealed for information after a woman was raped by two men on a canal path.
The 32-year-old travelled to the path in Clydebank from the Glasgow area with three men on Sunday evening.
Two of the men carried out the assault near to Jellicoe Street.
The victim went to a nearby shop for help and police were called. She suffered minor abrasions but did not want medical attention.
Police&nbsp;Scotland&nbsp;have appealed for information about the attack, which happened between 8.30pm and 9.30pm.
Detective Inspector Douglas Wilson of Clydebank CID said: &quot;The victim will be re-interviewed in an effort to establish the full circumstances of events on Sunday evening. At this time, we know she went to the area with the males prior to the assault.
&quot;It is believed that they may have walked to the canal path having travelled to Dalmuir from Glasgow and I would ask anyone who remembers seeing a woman with three men walking in that direction to come forward.
&quot;I would also ask anyone who saw the assault, heard any sort of disturbance or witnessed the victim or suspects leaving the scene to telephone police.
&quot;I would like to reassure members of the public that everything is being done to trace those responsible for this crime. Officers will be in the area and I would encourage anyone with information, or indeed any concerns, to speak to them.&quot;
Two of the men are described as having shaved heads. One was tall and the other noticeably shorter.
