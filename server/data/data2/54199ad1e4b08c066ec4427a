Son Rikki is delighted his father’s musical legacy will live on Music legend Danny Kyle gets place in Hall of Fame - Daily Record The son of a Paisley music legend has told of his pride after it was announced his dad is to be awarded a prestigious honour.
Sixteen years after his death, folk icon Danny Kyle will be inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.
And his proud son Rikki, from the Shortroods area of Paisley, is delighted his father’s musical legacy will live on in such a way.
Rikki, 44, told the Paisley Daily Express: “It means so much to me and my family to know that, even 16 years after his death, my dad and his music still mean so much to people.
“He will be inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside many of his old friends – some still living and some dead – and it is fitting to see his name up there alongside them.”
Danny was one of the best-known and most-loved characters on the Scottish folk music scene and was involved in many of the country’s finest festivals.
He was instantly recognisable, with his trademark bunnet and loud ties, and people who knew him would comment on his great sense of humour.
The Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame is run by Hands Up For Trad – a group that was formed in 2002 with the aim of increasing the profile of traditional music.
Danny’s induction will take place at a special dinner to be staged at the Oran Mor, in Glasgow, on Friday, October 24.
Rikki added: “I’ll be going along to the dinner with Liz Clark, who was a close friend of my dad.
“Each year at the Celtic Connections festival, in Glasgow, and also at The Spree, in Paisley, she has curated the Danny Kyle Stage in dad’s honour.
“I’m sure she’ll be delighted to see my dad being inducted into the Hall of Fame.”
