STUDENTS at the world-renowned school are in the middle of creating giant logos that will guide music fans to tickets for the Hydro bash. MTV team up with Glasgow School of Art for EMA Awards ticket treasure hunt logos - Daily Record MTV HAVE joined forces with Glasgow School of Art to create giant logos for the EMA Awards at the Hydro.
Students have been tasked with creating six unmissable eight-foot-high logos to capture Glasgow’s identity, which will go on display around some of the city’s best-known locations.
As well as promoting the big event and showcasing the talents of the world-renowned art school, the designs will form part of an interactive treasure hunt that will give fans one of the last chances to get their hands on tickets to the bash.

The students have been given free rein to make the logos stand out as much as possible and MTV is looking for the most original and innovative designs, with everything from neon to tartan and fur to feathers expected to be employed.

Jo Bacon, vice-president of marketing, creative and publicity at MTV UK, said: “The whole MTV team has been captured by the Glaswegian style and spirit and we thought this would be a great way to add a touch of the city’s charm to our brand.&nbsp;
“The Glasgow School of Art has an amazing reputation and we are excited to see the students finished designs.

Steve Rigley, lecturer in graphic design at Glasgow School of Art, said: &quot;It is rare for a global brand to present such an open brief.
&quot;Our students will relish the opportunity.&quot;
The logos will be unveiled from Tuesday, November 4.
MTV have also announced they're looking for 2000 Scots music fans to be part of the action next month.
