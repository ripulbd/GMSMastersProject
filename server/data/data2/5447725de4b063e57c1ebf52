HUNDREDS of new jobs are on the horizon for the Easterhouse mall. Â£45m Fort extension promises big jobs boost for local folk HUNDREDS of new jobs are on the horizon for the Easterhouse mall.Marks &amp; Spencer is set to create 250 posts when it opens a new store at Glasgow Fort in the spring, while another 250 staff are to be hired by four other new retailers and an eaterie.The jobs joy has been triggered by a &pound;45million extension to the existing mall, which is expected to be completed in around six months time. The flagship M&amp;S store was to have been built five years ago but the plans were put on hold because of the global financial crisis.Construction, however, has been underway now for months and, once completed, it will extend the Fort by almost a half, and is expected to draw in more shoppers.Phil Goodman said: &quot;We are delighted that this much-anticipated development has now started. M&amp;S is a fantastic name to add to our list of stores and we are confident it will be a major draw for people.&quot;Once the new traders open up shop, the Fort's head count will soar to around 3000 workers. Currently, two-thirds of staff live in the Easterhouse area.
