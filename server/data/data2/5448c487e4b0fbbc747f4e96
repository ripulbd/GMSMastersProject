IT'S TRY It and See Week for would-be volunteers looking for opportunities to make a difference to people's lives. Try it and see - why not be a volunteer? IT'S TRY It and See Week for would-be volunteers looking for opportunities to make a difference to people's lives.Dozens of organisations have already signed up, and there is still time to get involved.Organised by Volunteer Glasgow, it's all part of the Legacy 2014 programme, with the success of Glasgow's Commonwealth Games Clydesiders and Host City Volunteers inspiring many to consider volunteering.Drew O'Donnell was a Host City Volunteer at the Games - and he's also made tea for the WRVS in Paisley, handed out goodie bags at the Great Scottish Run and supported runners (while avoiding getting too close to them) at Cancer Research UK's Pretty Muddy Race.&quot;I've been volunteering since I was 16 and still at school,&quot; grins the 23-year-old, who is from Paisley.&quot;I saw a poster in the WRVS shop, which said they were looking for help in the cafe, so I went in and offered to do it.&quot;It was great fun and it really made me think about how I could help other people just by giving up my time for a wee while after school.&quot;Drew volunteered for two and a half years at the Create youth group in his home town and then signed up to direct runners at Cancer Research UK's Pretty Muddy Race in Bellahouston Park.&quot;That was a lot of fun, but whereas at the Games you were high-fiving everyone, you really didn't want to go anywhere near those really, really muddy people,&quot; Drew laughs.Drew is hoping his volunteering experience will also help him find a job.&quot;I'm unemployed - it is a tough jobs market at the moment,&quot; he explains.&quot;But one of the benefits of volunteering is that employers see what a range of experience you have and can see all the skills you have developed, so it's a great thing to put on your CV.&quot;Try it and See week runs until Saturday, as Volunteer Glasgow operations manager David Maxwell explains.&quot;The week is an excellent opportunity for anyone thinking about volunt eering to get a taster of what it would be like,&quot; he says.&quot;You'll be able to see what you could be doing on a regular basis and how you can make a real difference to the lives of others - perhaps just by helping out for a couple of hours a week.&quot;Dozens of organisations across the city have already signed up to provide the opportunity for potential volunteers to visit them.Organisations already involved include: British Red Cross, Young Persons Befriending Service, Citizens Advice Direct, Home Start Glasgow, Scottish Refugee Council, National Autistic Society, Playbusters, Cancer Support Scotland and the Govanhill Baths Charity Shop.&quot;The success of the Commonwealth Games proves there is an enormous appetite for Glaswegians giving up their time to help others, says David&quot;AND he goes on: &quot;We want to use this week to show people how many different opportunities there are for people looking to enhance their own lives through helping others.&quot;We are appealing for anyone interested in volunteering to come along and spend some time at one or more of the many organisations taking part.&quot;Drew is already planning to do more volunteering, including a spell at the Scottish Open Badminton Grand Prix, in the Emirates Arena in November.&quot;Thanks to the Games, I now have a really good group of friends,&quot; he explains.&quot;I even got to meet Alex Salmond, the former First Minister, when he came to one of the events in Glasgow.&quot;He was great - really friendly and spent ages talking to us all.&quot;Drew adds: &quot;Glasgow had an amazing atmosphere all summer and the volunteers at the Games were a huge part of that.&quot;I love volunteering and I'd urge anyone thinking about doing it to go for it.&quot;He smiles: &quot;You never know what will come of it for you, and the benefits for the people you are helping are enormous.&quot;ann.fotheringham@ heraldandtimes.co.uk
