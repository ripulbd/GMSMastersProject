 Reflecting on Glasgow's win, head coach Eddie Wolecki Black said: &quot;Cup ties are about one thing and that's about getting into the next round. 
 &quot;Firstly I am delighted we are through to the semi-final draw. However the pleasing thing is that we have managed to achieve that by turning in an excellent performance. 
 &quot;The build-up play was done at a tempo that suited us, our combination play was of a high standard and the variety of chances we created was great to watch. 
 &quot;Courtney Whyte's second goal was a superb finish but the build-up to the goal was as good as I have seen from us. 
 &quot;We have once again returned another clean sheet and that adds to our confidence. We can look forward to the cup draw at Hampden and now have a full week to prepare for the visit to Rangers in a top of the table clash.&quot;
