A BID to open a 24-hour gym in Shawlands Arcade has got the go-ahead despite almost 1000 objections. Councillors back 24-hour mall gym despite almost 1000 objections A BID to open a 24-hour gym in Shawlands Arcade has got the go-ahead despite almost 1000 objections.City councillors approved the scheme after hearing the mall was &quot;struggling badly&quot; with almost half its units lying empty -some for years.Pure Gym, which operates across the UK, plans to remove 10 shop units at the back of the arcade to create a large gym, which will be open round the clock.But the move resulted in 941 objections from locals, including complaints from Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Shawlands and Strathbungo community council and Shawlands Business Association.They were concerned about the loss of a large shopping unit within the centre and the impact on local people of the gym operating 24 hours a day,But councillors were told mall bosses have been unable to persuade retailers to take over empty units which have no street frontage.Tony Donnelly, managing director of AWG Property, which owns Shawlands Arcade, said an added problem is that local people are choosing to shop at Silverburn or in the city centre.He said the firm bought the arcade seven years ago and had invested a large sum in developing the shopping complex but had failed to find a big retailer prepared to move in.Mr Donnelly admitted Sainsbury's only opened in the arcade because it was offered a unit with a street frontage, rent-free, for two years.The mall boss added: &quot;Fifteen of the 31 units are not let, which is the poorest occupancy of any centre we have in Scotland. Five units have been empty for 19 years.&quot;People in Shawlands will travel into the city centre and to Silverburn which will always outclass us.&quot;The bottom line is, I cannot let the space at the back - we are just surviving - so Pure Gym is vital for the success of this centre as it will make a 15- year, long term investment. I don't have a plan B.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
