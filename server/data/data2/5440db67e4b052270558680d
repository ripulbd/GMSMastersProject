TV appeal in bid to catch fugitive Kelly MILLIONS of television viewers watched as police launched a fresh bid for information about Glasgow fugitive Jonathan Kelly.Detectives are hoping last night's nationwide TV appeal will lead to a breakthrough in the case.A special appeal was broadcast on BBC's Crimewatch in a desperate bid to find one of Britain's most wanted men.The 34-year-old machete thug has been on the run for a month, since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.For the first time, it was revealed Kelly uses a &quot;number of aliases&quot; including Donald Cameron, John Kerr, and Jonathan Donnelly.Police believe he may have shaved his head or grown a beard in a bid to disguise himself.Viewers were shown a picture of Kelly, from Drumchapel, in the hope someone will recognise him.The fugitive was top of the show's Wanted Faces list.It was also revealed Kelly has several large scars, including one on his right hand.Presenter Martin Bayfield said: &quot;He was released from prison on licence in August after serving a number of years for violent offences, but has since gone missing.&quot;Kelly, who is considered to be dangerous, uses a number of aliases. He should not be approached.&quot;So if you see him, or know where he is, call 999 immediately.&quot;Police believe someone has information about Kelly's whereabouts - but is helping to keep him one step ahead of officers.Detective Superintendent Stevie Grant, of Greater Glasgow Division CID, urged anyone helping Kelly to give him up.He said: &quot;Consider the additional pressure harbouring Mr Kelly will place on you and your family as time goes on, and you come to the attention of the police.&quot;Meanwhile, Crimestoppers is offering a &pound;1000 reward in a bid to snare the serial offender.
