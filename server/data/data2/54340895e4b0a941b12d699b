Scottish Government fund to treat rare conditions doubles to £40m A Scottish Government fund to pay for new drugs to treat rare conditions is to double to £40 million, the Health Secretary said today.The New Medicines Fund will replace and expand the Rare Conditions Medicines Fund set up in March last year, giving health boards access to greater resources to fund the cost of new medicines, Alex Neil said.In 2013/14 the Rare Conditions Medicines Fund supported the cost of 45 different medicines for more than 200 patients with conditions including cystic fibrosis and Hodgkin's Lymphoma.The new fund is being established with the rebate to the Scottish Government made by the pharmaceutical industry under the UK-wide branded drug pricing scheme the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme.It also follows changes to the way drugs are assessed by the Scottish Medicines Consortium.Mr Neil said: &quot;Parliament has considered the issue of access to new medicines very carefully in the last 18 months and there was a clear consensus that steps should be taken to improve access to new medicines for rare conditions and for people who have terminal conditions.&quot;That's why I tasked the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) to develop new ways to ensure the voices of patients and clinicians were better heard in the new medicines approval process, and to ensure that access was improved to medicines for rare and end-of-life conditions.&quot;The SMC have now started to implement these changes and we will be closely monitoring them to determine if any further action is needed in the future.&quot;The dedicated &pound;40 million New Medicines Fund will complement these changes and will help ensure that more patients get access to the latest medicines as quickly as possible.&quot;Alastair Kent, of Genetic Alliance UK, a charity which helps patients affected by genetic conditions, said: &quot;Advances in research are creating new hope for patients with incurable rare diseases.&quot;Without funding, this hope will be frustrated, as those in need will not be able to benefit from the therapies produced, and patients will continue to suffer when something might have been done.&quot;We hope that the rules for accessing this new funding will be simple, widely disseminated and speedy in their operation.&quot;
