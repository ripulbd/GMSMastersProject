The blaze caused extensive damage to the iconic Mackintosh building and destroyed its famous library. 
GSA had identified books for priority replacement that were in high demand by students, staff and researchers.
The art school said it had now replaced almost a quarter of these books thanks to the &quot;huge generosity of private individuals and institutions&quot;.
Duncan Chappell, academic liaison librarian at GSA said: &quot;In the three-month period since the fire we have successfully replaced 22% of the volumes we identified as a priority because they were in high demand and used regularly by our students, staff and researchers. 
&quot;We have been very touched by the generosity shown to us which is testament to the affection in which the Mackintosh Library was held by so many.&quot;
Among the many books received were Agnes Miller Parker's XXI Welsh gypsy folk-tales, donated by Blackwells Rare Books.
The volume is illustrated with original wood engravings and published by Gregynog Press (1933), one of the most important British private press of the inter-war period. 
The limited edition - number 216 of 250 - has its original mustard bevel-edged sheepskin binding.
An anonymous donor also gave the art school Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring) 1898-1903, published by Gerlach and Schenk.
This was the official magazine of the Vienna Secession and helped popularise Art Nouveau across Europe.
GSA said the rebuilding of its lost collections &quot;could take many years&quot;.
