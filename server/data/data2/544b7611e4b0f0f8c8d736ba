 Dundee welcome back defender James McPake following a bereavement for the visit of league leaders Hamilton. 
 But goalkeeper Kyle Letheren is injured, along with Luka Tankulic and Peter MacDonald, while Simon Ferry has not recovered fully from a virus. 
 Hamilton skipper Martin Canning is available after the knee surgery which caused him to miss five games. 
 And midfielder Jon Routledge is also back to full fitness following a midweek run out for the reserves. 
  Dundee manager Paul Hartley:  &quot;All credit to Hamilton for what they have done so far this season. They're sitting top just now and that's down to all their efforts and some very good results. 
 &quot;But it's up to us to try and take the game to them and see if we can get the three points. 
 &quot;We want to get that first home win in front of our own supporters as soon as possible. 
 &quot;There should be a good crowd with a great atmosphere. It's the game of the day in the division and you can't ask for much more than that.&quot; 
  Hamilton manager Alex Neil:  &quot;Both clubs have got different ways of doing things. They have signed 14 or 15 new players, while we have mainly stuck with the guys who got us here. 
 &quot;But it doesn't mean both teams can't have success. Dundee have been relatively successful for a team coming up and have started well. 
 &quot;But I don't think last season will have any bearing on the game whatsoever.&quot;
