Dozens of jobs safe as phone firm fails DOZENS of Scottish jobs have been saved following the collapse of Phones 4u.Administrators have revealed more than 10 stores are re-opening after being bought by two rival mobile network providers while almost 60 stricken staff have been snapped up by the newly launched Dixons Carphone.Rescue packages by Vodafone and EE have meant a total of 81 workers will keep their jobs with the relaunch of 13 stores across Scotland, including seven in the west at Cumbernauld, Motherwell, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Kilmarnock, Ayr and Glasgow's Buchanan Galleries.The deals to relaunch those stores will save 36 jobs in and around Glasgow, while 12 other workers in the city have been offered a lifeline by the recent merger of Dixons Retail and the Carphone Warehouse.Nine Phones 4u concession stalls which operated in Currys/PC World stores north of the border have also closed but Dixons bosses have taken on the 59 workers who manned those stalls - 12 in Glasgow and 22 in Hamilton, Coatbridge, Falkirk and Livingston.The breakdown was made public by administrators at PwC and while 140 Scots workers get to keep their jobs another 145 are now in the nation's dole queue.Joint administrator Rob Hunt said there was little interest in the rest of the stricken Phones 4u network and as a result 362 stores will remain closed with the loss of 1697 jobs.He said: &quot;It is with much regret that we have today made the difficult decision to close a large number of stores. It is a sad day for the staff working at those locations and our thoughts are with them.&quot;But Mr Hunt pledged: &quot;We will make every effort to help the affected staff, working with the Phones 4u HR team over the coming days to support employees.&quot;
