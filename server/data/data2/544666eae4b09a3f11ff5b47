Scots author Janice Galloway's stalker ex walks free from court - Daily Record A PIANIST who harassed author Janice Galloway walked free from court yesterday.
Graeme McNaught, 54, of Mount Vernon, Glasgow, faced five charges of acting in a threatening and abusive manner and placing Janice in a state of fear and alarm.
The pair had a six-year on-off relationship after meeting in 1990 and have a 22-year-old son, James.
Janice, 58, her husband Jonathan May and James all gave evidence during McNaught’s two-week trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court.
The writer, of Uddingston, near Glasgow, had broken down in tears as she told how McNaught said he had naked photos of her pregnant and planned to show them at an art exhibition.
The trial was halted amid concerns over McNaught’s mental health. The jury were discharged and Sheriff Ray Small then conducted an examination of facts.
When McNaught returned to court yesterday, the sheriff told him: “I was satisfied that you did carry out the acts.
“The Crown have asked for a non-harassment order but an examination of facts means there is no conviction and I can only make such an order if there is a conviction.”
