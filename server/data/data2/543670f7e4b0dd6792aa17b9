Plans unveiled for Scotland's first coffee festival A GLASGOW fundraiser is full of beans after revealing plans for Scotland's first coffee festival.Chris Brown, who works for the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, will stage the inaugural event at the Drygate micro-brewery and bar in the East End next month.The 29-year-old said there was a bit of a buzz about coffee in the city, with &quot;so much more on offer than just Starbucks and Costa.&quot;Caffeine-crazy Chris, who moved to Glasgow a year ago, said he was inspired by similar festivals in London and Amsterdam.He said: &quot;I went to the one in London which attracted 40,000 people over three days.&quot;It's something that's been growing in popularity in recent years. We've got festivals for everything in Scotland - for wine, beer and chocolate - but not coffee!&quot;Chris thinks Glasgow could be the perfect venue for the festival. Drygate, which is based beside the Tennent Caledonian brewery on Duke Street, recently hosted the successful Craft Beer Rising festival.He and colleague Elisa Dunn, together with her husband, Stephen, are busy organising the event for Saturday November 29.Chris added: &quot;People are becoming more knowledgeable about coffee.&quot;There are so many more coffee shops. In Glasgow you've got great cafes, like the Riverhill, Gordon Street Coffee, Paper Cup and Artisan Roasters.&quot;The coffee scene is continuing to grow.&quot;Chris, whose two favourite coffees are a latte or a cinnamon cappuccino, spent some time working on a coffee plantation in Cuba when he was doing a charity trek.He said: &quot;I also lived in Florida for four years and coffee is massive in the US.&quot;But it's gaining in popularity over here and it seems to be the right time to do this.&quot;The festival will offer different types of coffee to sample, plus demonstrations on roasting and latte art - patterns made in the milk foam - plus live music.Chris said he had &quot;the best cafes in Glasgow&quot; lined up to take part. He said full details would be announced in the next few weeks.He added: &quot;The reaction to this on social media has been quite overwhelming.&quot;We'll gauge how popular it is but we hope it could grow every year.&quot;There's a big appetite and enthusiasm for these kind of events so it's a great platform for these brands to showcase their products.&quot;Tickets are on sale now, for &pound;8, with &pound;1 going towards the hospice's Brick by Brick Appeal, backed by the Evening Times, to build a new facility on a site at Bellahouston Park..Donations will also be taken on the day, which runs from 11am to 6pm.See www.scottishcoffeefestival.com for tickets.To learn more or to make a donation, visit www.ppwh.org.uk/brickbybrick, call 0141 429 9861 or email brickbybrick@ppwh.org.ukvictoria.brenan@eveningtimes.co.uk
