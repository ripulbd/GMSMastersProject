PUPILS have paid special tribute to a much-loved dinner lady who died ­suddenly. Special tribute to much-loved city dinner lady PUPILS have paid special tribute to a much-loved dinner lady who died ­suddenly.Catering Assistant Shirley Gould passed away just six weeks after being diagnosed with lung cancer.Devastated Cleveden Secondary youngsters decided to do something to honour her &quot;larger than life&quot; character.Instead of a memorial bench, a group from the school's Prince's Trust XL Programme commissioned an eight-seater table and chairs.Shirley's catchphrase was, &quot;Are you listening?&quot; and the pupils hope to turn it into a listening zone and outdoor garden.Cleveden Secondary headteacher Roger Boyle said: &quot;Shirley was affectionately known by the young people and staff at Cleveden as Big Shirley and always had a smile and a kind word for everyone.&quot;She is missed by all of us and I am so proud that our staff and young people will not forget her.&quot;The bench is a lovely way for all of us to keep her in our thoughts. Our Fuel Zone is just not the same without her.&quot;Staff and pupils said Shirley, 62, was hugely popular throughout the school in Glasgow where she worked during her 25 years.Catering manager Michelle Russell said: &quot;Shirley was &shy;really popular and it came as a huge shock when she was diagnosed.&quot;We miss her and we mention her every day. It's really hard for us as Shirley was such a big character and great with the kids - she could speak to them on their level.&quot;We think the new bench is beautiful, it's absolutely wonderful as a tribute to her.&quot;XL Programme pupils approached guidance teacher Derek Bruce who donated the first &pound;10 towards materials.Youngsters then arranged two raffles to raise money - one with prizes for the pupils and the other for prizes for the teachers and support staff. They also sold cakes to raise &pound;250.A parent of one pupil owns firm Rearo Laminates in Govan, which donated time and built the bench while money raised paid for the materials.Shirley's husband Kenny and son Alan were invited to a special unveiling.The couple had three sons, Alan, 28, David, 34, and &shy;Kenneth, who died four years ago, aged 32.Kenny, 62, said: &quot;Shirley was the bravest person I have ever met. I was with her for 44 years. This is a really beautiful thing the pupils have done for her and I will be going up to visit the bench and think about her.&quot;catriona.stewart@eveningtimes.co.uk
