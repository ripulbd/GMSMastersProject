Europa League: Dinamo Zagreb 'here to win' - Josip Simunic  Dinamo Zagreb captain Josip Simunic says the Croatian champions have &quot;come here to win&quot; as he looks forward to facing Celtic in the Europa League. 
 The 36-year-old's team lead Group D after crushing Romanian outfit Astra 5-1 in their opening game. 
 Scottish champions Celtic, who have been inconsistent domestically, opened with a draw in Salzburg. 
 &quot;We're expecting a very difficult game,&quot; Simunic said. &quot;But we didn't come here to lose.&quot; 
 It is 12 games since Dinamo have suffered a defeat, losing 2-0 to Aalborg in the third qualifying round of the Champions League to undo a 1-0 win in Denmark. 
 “We know where Celtic are strong and where their weaknesses are” 
 Celtic dropped into the Europa League after their defeat by unfancied Maribor and presently lie fourth in the Scottish Premiership. 
 But defender Simunic said: &quot;Celtic are always strong. I watched Celtic as a child in Australia, I was born and bred there. 
 &quot;Celtic are a huge club. Everyone knows that.&quot; 
 The veteran former Hamburg, Hertha Berlin and Hoffenheim defender has only played once before in Scotland - when he earned one of his 105 caps for Croatia in a friendly. 
 &quot;Maybe at the moment Celtic are not doing the best they can, but we are expecting a big, fanatical crowd and we are going to do our best,&quot; he added. 
 &quot;We've looked at them a few times and they are very good. 
 &quot;We know where they are strong and where their weaknesses are and we'll see what happens tomorrow.&quot;
