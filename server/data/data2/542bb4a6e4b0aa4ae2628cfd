GEIR SVOREN is convinced his unknown paternal grandfather was Scottish, likely from Glasgow and served in World War II, visiting Norway in May 1945. Hunt on for World War II veteran who doesn't know he has family in Norway - Daily Record A MAN is searching for the long lost grandfather in Glasgow who doesn’t know he has a family in Norway.
Geir Svoren is convinced his lost relative was Scottish and likely from Glasgow and served in World War II, visiting Norway in May 1945.
But the man – a David Stout or Stouth – left without realising Geir’s grandmother, Marta Kristiansen, was pregnant and he and his Scottish family would be unaware they have Norwegian relatives.
Geir said: “My father almost died a few years ago and has been wondering all his life about his father and what he looked like. There was a photo of him that doesn’t exist anymore.
“I started searching because I wanted my dad to know his father before he died.
“I’m sure my grandfather has passed so I’m really looking for his children and I believe they are in Scotland. I had indications he was in Glasgow. I’m quite optimistic.”
Marta Kristiansen, now 94, has two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren who would all be related to the Scot.
Geir’s research has led him to conclude his grandfather was likely in the Royal Navy or a commando.
He added: “My search has been long and hard due to lack of information.
“We only have his name and not his service number or birth date and the Navy would love to help but without a service number it is difficult. We do suspect that he was serving on a MTB (motor torpedo boat) but we do not know for sure.
“I even started calling people in Glasgow with his name to ask if they knew about a David Stout who served in the war.”
Anyone with information is asked to contact Geir at gsvoren@broadpark.no.
