A teenager has been raped in broad daylight on a cycle path Glasgow teenager raped in cycle path attack A teenager has been raped in broad daylight on a cycle path.

The 18-year-old was attacked at about 2.15pm yesterday between Johnstone and Linwood in Renfrewshire.
She was not hurt but has been left “extremely distressed”, Police Scotland said.
The victim was confronted by a man at an area of the path known locally as “the pencil” statue.
After waiting for a woman pushing a pram to walk past, he grabbed the victim and dragged her into nearby bushes, where he subjected her to a serious sexual assault.
He then made off in the direction of Johnstone.
Detective Inspector Mark McGowan said: “The victim and her family are extremely distressed following her ordeal and our specially-trained officers are supporting her.
“I’d like to reassure the local community that we are continuing significant enquiries into this incident.
“This was a sunny day and there would have been a number of people using the cycle track at this time.
“I need them and the woman who the victim described as pushing a pram at the same time the man stopped to come forward and help me identify the person responsible for putting this young woman through this terrifying ordeal while she was simply making her home.”
The man is described as white, between 20 and 30, 5ft 10ins, of slim build and with a local accent.
At the time of the incident he was wearing a grey hooded top and grey matching bottoms.
He was also carrying a green cylindrical bag, similar to a tent bag, over his shoulder.
