House hunters will no longer be eligible for shared equity on properties between £250,000 and £400,000 after the Scottish Government slashed the upper limit on its Help to Buy scheme. Help to Buy capped at £250,000 House hunters will no longer be eligible for shared equity on properties between £250,000 and £400,000 after the Scottish Government slashed the upper limit on its Help to Buy scheme.The decision is designed to widen access to lower income families and first-time buyers by favouring less expensive houses, according to Housing Minister Margaret Burgess.Trade body Homes for Scotland welcomed the move following the &quot;market disruption&quot; caused after Help to Buy funding for 2014/15 ran out in July.However, the &pound;100 million allocated for 2015/16 is not expected to last the full year as the new cap will still cover the vast majority of the market, Homes for Scotland chief executive Philip Hogg said.Mrs Burgess said: &quot;By targeting the scheme at properties at or below a value of &pound;250,000, the scheme will support first-time buyers and people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to buy a new-build home.&quot;The changes will also see the benefits of Help to Buy extended for as long as possible and build on the widely welcomed arrangements for the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax announced by the Finance Secretary last week.&quot;We will continue to monitor this successful scheme and will look at ways of making sure everyone in Scotland has access to good quality, affordable homes.&quot;Ministers have allocated &pound;275 million to the scheme to date, which is &pound;55 million more than the industry's original &pound;220 million request.Mr Hogg said: &quot;Given the scheme generated nearly 5,000 reservations and sales in just 10 months before demand exhausted the budget allocation for this financial year, this interruption has resulted in significant business uncertainty as the industry awaited the Scottish Government's next move.&quot;This adjustment to a &pound;250,000 maximum house price for 2015/16 transactions does, however, provide some clarity to both builders and buyers.&quot;Still covering the vast majority of the market, it will also ensure that the limited funds are targeted to help more of those most in need, however, we still suspect that even with this change the &pound;100 million budget will be insufficient to last the full year.&quot;With demand for the scheme proven without doubt, we continue to press for an increased budget for next year in order to avoid a repeat of the stop-start experience of this year which seriously impacted business planning and caused anxiety and uncertainty for home buyers.&quot;We therefore hope that Help to Buy (Scotland), along with specific help for SMEs to enable them to build more homes under the scheme, will be obvious beneficiaries for the extra &pound;125 million housing investment announced in last week's draft Budget.&quot;
