MORE Labour politicians have ruled themselves out of contention for the vacant Scottish leader's post. More step back from Labour's hot seat MORE Labour politicians have ruled themselves out of contention for the vacant Scottish leader's post.Several names who were previously mentioned as potential candidates to take over from Johann Lamont have said they will not be seeking election.As yet no-one has said they are seeking nominations to enter the race for Scottish Leader.Glasgow Central MP Anas Sarwar, the current interim leader, issued a statement saying he was not standing.Earlier, more experienced politicians, Glasgow East MP, Margaret Curran and West Dunbartonshire MSP, Jackie Baillie said they would not be contenders.Two women, elected to Holyrood in 2011 and considered rising stars in the party, Jenny Marra and Kezia Dugdale have also said no.Former cabinet minister Malcolm Chisholm had earlier said he was strongly urging Ms Dugdale to stand.East Renfrewshire MP Jim Murphy is left looking like favourite, with current Scottish health spokesman Neil Findlay looking like the only possible from the ranks of the MSPs. Mr Findlay however, while not ruling himself out, said he wanted former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, to run for the job. Sources close to Mr Brown, however, reported last night that he would not be running.One said: &quot;For the past four years, and on every occasion he has been asked, Mr Brown has made it clear he is not returning to frontline politics. That position has not changed.&quot;Mr Sarwar, as reported in later editions of the Evening Times yesterday, said he would be focussing on his role as interim leader and looking to ensure the party emerges stronger as a result of the contest and gaining more powers for Scotland through the Smith Commission talks.He said: &quot;I can confirm that I am not seeking nomination to be Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.&quot;There is a crucial job to be done in this interim period. For the last three years it has been my priority to keep the UK family together, in this coming period I am clear that we will keep the Scottish Labour family together.&quot;Nominations must be received by November 4, the ballot will begin on November 17 and the new leader elected on December 13.If an MP is elected, it would mean someone from the MSPs being chosen to lead the party at Holyrood and take on Nicola Sturgeon at First Minister's Questions when she takes over as expected later next month, when Alex Salmond steps down.That could see a similar situation to the SNP in 2004 when Mr Salmond was an MP and selected leader with Ms Sturgeon as deputy in charge at Holyrood waiting until Mr Salmond won a seat in 2007.Mr Sarwar however, is the current Deputy leader and has not indicated he will resign from that post meaning the leader and deputy could both potentially be MPs going in to the next Holyrood elections in 2016.Mr Murphy or Mr Brown, should either declare, would require to find a constituency to contest in 2016 or be number one on the party's regional list if he stands and commits to being at Holyrood, as it is expected the Scottish Leader would.Meanwhile Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls has become the most senior Labour politician to dismiss Mr Lamont's criticism of the Scottish Party being treated like a &quot;branch office&quot; by London led Labour.He said &quot;We are a UK party but have a really vibrant and dynamic Labour Party in Scotland.&quot;I saw the remarks, I understand she is resigning and in those moments you say those kinds of things.&quot;I think what people in Scotland want is a strong voice for Scotland in Scotland and in the UK, delivering in Holyrood and making sure the Scottish voice is heard loud and clear.&quot;I am confident the next Labour leader will do that.&quot;stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
