THE boss of the family company, which has been in business in the city for more than a century, reckons Glasgow is a great place to do business. Made in Glasgow: Shearer Candles boss Ian Barnet sheds some light on benefits of Govan factory - Daily Record IAN BARNET says that when it comes to manufacturing, other cities don’t hold a candle to Glasgow.
 The owner and MD of Govan-based Shearer Candles , Ian is always ready to wax lyrical on the many perks of operating out Scotland’s biggest population centre. 
But the chandler king reckons the light of knowledge for our young people must be encouraged for manufacturing to thrive.
He said: “Glasgow is extremely well placed. Our transportation links are fantastic for export and it’s easy for clients to visit us from China, Europe and the US. There are challenges though and I’d like to see more education and training opportunities for local people, especially the young.”
Founded in Glasgow in 1897, the firm was once chandler to the British Empire, producing millions of cheap candles.
After being bought by Ian in 1972, they recreated themselves as a upmarket producer that can be found across the globe.
Ian said: “We’re proud that for so many years we have been employing, manufacturing and exporting here in Glasgow.
“We need to keep building confidence in the business community, old and new, that we are more than capable of manufacturing in Scotland.
“We all need to address the reluctance and fear that many face in this country and also ensure that costs are kept down so it becomes far more attractive to manufacture here than in other places.”
