Why city galleries scare off locals PEOPLE from Glasgow's deprived areas feel too intimidated to visit some of the city's museums and art galleries, research suggests.A study has shown many residents believe museums are targeted at the upper classes, the educated or tourists.The Gallery of Modern Art and Trongate 103 were among the attractions considered &quot;too superior&quot; by residents surveyed in areas including Pollok, Castlemilk and Govan.The Burrell Collection was also singled out because the way exhibits were arranged was said to discourage interaction.Those deemed the most accessible to all and family-friendly included the Riverside Museum, Kelvingrove, Scotland Street School Museum and the People's Palace.One respondent from Govan said: &quot;I wouldn't know what I'm looking at. But I wouldn't ask them because the staff act like they know it all, and would think, &quot;Why do people from Govan come here?!&quot;Another, said &quot;museums are for yuppies&quot; while some said galleries made them feel &quot;inferior and stupid.&quot;Residents were also more likely to visit galleries if they lived in regenerated parts of the more deprived communities, according to the report, carried out by Glasgow Centre for Population Health and Glasgow Life, which runs the City's museums and galleries.Mark O'Neill, Director of Policy and Research at Glasgow Life, said: &quot;We commissioned this report precisely to understand these barriers, so that we can address them. Glasgow has nine civic museums, each of which attract different audiences for different reasons but we want to ensure that everyone can enjoy the very best in contemporary art.&quot;Contemporary art is often seen and portrayed as being difficult to access, but we've already had success at GoMA, with almost one in ten visitors coming from the city's most deprived areas.&quot;This is something we want to build on, and of all Glasgow Museums, it is the most attractive to young people aged 16-24, from all social groups.&quot;caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
