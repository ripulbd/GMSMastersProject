 New signing James McFadden could make his St Johnstone debut against St Mirren. 
 On-loan Brian Graham returns for Saints after sitting out last weekend's defeat to his parent club Dundee United, but Chris Millar is a doubt. 
 Adam Drury returns to the St Mirren squad after recovering from an ankle injury. 
 However, Jeroen Tesselaar, Ellis Plummer, Gary Teale, Isaac Osbourne and Steven Thompson remain out. 
  St Johnstone midfielder Simon Lappin:  &quot;I have known James [McFadden] since I was 13 years old when we were both playing for Motherwell's youth teams. 
 &quot;You could seen even then that he was a special talent and he's proved that with the career he's gone on to have, playing at the highest level with Scotland and down south in the Premiership. 
 &quot;Hopefully he can come in and do what he has been doing for the last 15 years, which is creating chances and scoring goals.&quot; 
  St Mirren defender Jim Goodwin:  &quot;St Johnstone are on a poor run in the league, they have lost their last three league games, so both of us are fighting for our lives at the moment. 
 &quot;It is always a difficult game there. They are well-organised team with top professionals.&quot;
