THE number of motorists illegally driving through a controversial bus gate has fallen by almost 77% since its introduction. 77% drop in motorists ignoring new bus gate THE number of motorists illegally driving through a controversial bus gate has fallen by almost 77% since its introduction.But in the last week of September, more than 1000 people were still hit with fixed penalty notices for flouting the rules.The bus gate, at Nelson Mandela Place, was introduced by Glasgow City Council on June 30.In the first full week of operation a total of 4860 penalty notices were issued - a daily average of 694.New figures show that in the week starting September 27, that number had fallen to 1171 - a daily average of 167.The bus gate operates from 7am until 7pm seven days a week and, according to roads bosses, has led to a drop in congestion, a fall in harmful traffic emissions and improvements in the environment for pedestrians.They also say there has been an improvement in bus journey times and reliability through Nelson Mandela Place and George Square.Alistair Watson, the council's land and environmental services spokesman, said: &quot;It is reassuring to see a massive drop - almost 77% - in the number of offences detected in the first three months and it is hoped this trend will continue.&quot;It is encouraging that drivers are modifying their behaviour.&quot;It is important we work to ensure public transport services are given priority and this is respected by the majority of drivers.&quot;As a direct result, there has been a noticeable reduction in the degree of congestion and vehicle pollution in the area.&quot;This reduction has led to improved pedestrian access to the entrance of Queen Street Station and better access for buses to the busy stops on the north side of West George Street.&quot;Around &pound;30million was invested by the council, First Glasgow and the Scottish Government in a bid to improve public transport in the city and the bus lane and enforcement scheme is helping to get full benefit from that.&quot;Regrettably, some drivers continue to break the law and as with many other driving offences, camera enforcement is an effective deterrent.&quot;In September, road bosses were forced to introduce improved road markings warning the bus gate was in operation.That followed some motorists saying they spotted the road markings so late they opted to reverse out of the street rather than face a fine.Neil Greig, of the IAM Motoring Trust welcomed the new figures.He said: &quot;It shows they are starting to get the message but it may be more word of mouth than anything the council has done.&quot;I have no evidence to show banning traffic from using Nelson Mandela Place is causing traffic congestion elsewhere.&quot;Based on my observations when I have gone there, the bus gate is causing confusion rather than congestion, but I don't know whether that leads to longer journey times.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
