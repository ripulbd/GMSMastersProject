 Glasgow Warriors are without captain Josh Strauss for their opening European Champions Cup match against Bath. 
 Strauss will be replaced in the back row by Adam Ashe with scrum-half Henry Pyrgos skippering the team. 
 Stuart Hogg, Duncan Weir, Pat McArthur, Jonny Gray, and Adam Ashe are among five changes for Warriors. 
 Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend expects his side to bounce back from their first defeat of the season last week against Ulster. 
 &quot;There has been a heightened level of excitement and anticipation around the club this week, as we get closer to the start of our new European Rugby Champions Cup campaign,&quot; he told the Glasgow website.&nbsp; 
 &quot;It's great that we're able to start this season's European campaign with a home game and we're expecting a bumper crowd at Scotstoun. 
 &quot;Bath are one of the form teams in England and seem to be full of confidence. 
 &quot;We are in a quality group with three of the leading sides in Europe. I imagine that every team in our group has the aim of progressing to the knockout stages and it should make for some fascinating contests. We can't wait for it to all get going on Saturday.&quot; 
  Glasgow Warriors:  Stuart Hogg; Sean Maitland, Mark Bennett, Peter Horne, Tommy Seymour; Duncan Weir, Henry Pyrgos (capt); Gordon Reid, Pat MacArthur, Euan Murray, Leone Nakarawa, Jonny Gray, Rob Harley, Chris Fusaro, Adam Ashe.
