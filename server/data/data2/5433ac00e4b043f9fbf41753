PLANS to build a new bridge over the Clyde received a vote of approval from local residents. Residents back Â£50m bid for new bridge on the Clyde PLANS to build a new bridge over the Clyde received a vote of approval from local residents.But the &pound;50million price tag raised the question of why it was so high.Last week The Evening Times reported the new road bridge would link Yoker, in the west of Glasgow, to Renfrew.Work on the project, which is being led by Renfrewshire Council, is likely to begin in 2018 or 2019.The bridge will be able to open to let vessels pass up and down the river.Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said it would be a &quot;spectacular sight&quot; when it is built.Retired Yoker resident, Sandra Aitken, 62, backed the plans.She said: &quot;For the people that live here, and the people in Knightswood, I think it's fantastic.&quot;It would take you to Braehead, instead of going away along through the Clyde Tunnel, so it'll be marvellous.&quot;Ms Aitken said she favoured a bridge over the existing Renfrew ferry, which runs every 30 minutes, connecting Yoker to Renfrew.She said: &quot;We've not got the big ferry now, it's that wee tiny one and I wouldn't go on it, I'm too frightened.&quot;Not everyone was overjoyed. Commuter Stuart Mitchell commented on The Evening Times Website: &quot;The roads through Renfrew town centre cannot cope with the current traffic.&quot;Adding more, via any new bridge, will just cause more tailbacks.&quot;It can take me 20 minutes to go a mile some evenings.&quot;One Yoker resident, who lives near the ferry quay, thought the bridge would help traffic in the area.Susan Edmiston, 66, said: &quot;I should imagine it could help the traffic. A lot of people park on this street and go across on the ferry. If it means they can get their car across on the bridge it'll lessen traffic on this street and could be all well and good.&quot;However, she was unsure about the planned cost.She said: &quot;&pound;50m is an awful lot of money just to build a bridge. I'm not sure exactly where they get their figures from.&quot;Local takeaway owners Catherine and James Richards, 53 and 58, from Yoker, both hope the bridge will improve business in the area during and after construction.James said: &quot;Over the years, the ferry has changed hands that many times, you don't even know who's going to be running the ferry.&quot;Now it's a wee tin thing.&quot;There's going to be a lot of workmen about when they build it and I've got a wee takeaway here so it's going to help my business, I hope.&quot;Catherine said: &quot;I suppose &pound;50m is a bit dear but it's still a good thing, it'll help traffic around here.&quot;It'll also improve businesses here because, when the ferry breaks down, nobody can get over to Yoker.&quot;The bridge is part of the &pound;1.13billion City Deal for the Glasgow region.The deal will sees the UK and Scottish Governments each give &pound;500m of extra investment to the city, which local councils will supplement by borrowing a further &pound;130m.This money will be used to pay for infrastructure projects which could boost the area's economy by &pound;2.4bn annually.Mr Macmillan said: &quot;Renfrewshire is at the forefront of the City Deal programme, with projects to develop the long-awaited rail link to Glasgow Airport and further development at Clyde Waterfront/Renfrew Riverside.&quot;The road bridge is another key project, which will bring benefits to both sides of the Clyde.&quot;
