ANGRY Yes and No supporters clashed in chaotic scenes in Glasgow's George Square. SUPPOrTERS IN ANGRY CLASHES ANGRY Yes and No supporters clashed in chaotic scenes in Glasgow's George Square.Hundreds of demons-trators gathered in the city centre waving Union flags and chanting Rule Britannia and other pro-union songs at the top of their voices in celebration at Scotland's failure to clinch independence.Van loads of police officers and mounted police turned up to ring the No supporters as they displayed Union Jacks with &quot;Scotland is British No Surrender&quot; emblazoned across them.Tensions were running high as both camps goaded each other and blue flares were thrown into the crowds. There were sporadic outbreaks of fighting and shouting as they vented their anger at each other over the referendum result.Many of the demons-trators were drunk and a lot of them were young people, some of school age.At one point a group of young girls with Yes Saltires on their faces were chased across the square by a gang of heavy, middle-aged men sporting Union Jack flags and shouting abuse.In another vicious scene two men, with flags of the opposite persuasion, began fighting and the crowds had to pull them apart.A car flying a Union flag, which was stopped at traffic lights in West Nile Street, was attacked and the flag was smashed through the back window. Luckily there were no passengers in the back of the car but it left the occupants badly shaken.The female passenger said: &quot;We were sitting at the lights and this guy came along, grabbed our flag and cracked it through the window. He was calling us names, saying we should go back to England, then he ran off. I am really angry.&quot;Some of the demons-trators with Union Jacks around their shoulders and holding bottles of booze shouted at the Yes supporters: &quot;We won fair and square. Royal standard. God save the Queen.&quot;A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: &quot;There has been some minor disorder which was quickly dealt with and it was well policed. No arrests have been made and the square has been closed to traffic.&quot;janice.burns@eveningtimes.co.uk
