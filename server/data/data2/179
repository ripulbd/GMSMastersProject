MORE than 30,000 runners hit the tarmac to take part in Scotland's most celebrated race for runners of all abilities - the Great Scottish Run.
Runners set off from George Square and straight up St Vincent Street, over the Clyde and round Pollok and Belahouston park in the Southside of the city, before crossing the Squinty Bridge to run back along the murder mile towards the finish line at Glasgow Green.
Some of the world's most celebrated runners participated in the 10K and half marathon races, including Haile Gebrselassie, who&nbsp;sadly had to retire from the race half-way through due to asthma and muscular problems.
We've collected some of the best images of the day so far, including a selection taken in front of the Daily Record building at Anderston Quay.
