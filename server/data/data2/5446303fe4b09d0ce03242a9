Two men were left with serious injuries after an unprovoked attack by a group of seven men, some wearing fancy dress, in Glasgow early on Sunday. Attackers wore Robin Hood hat and Heidi wig Two men were left with serious injuries after an unprovoked attack by a group of seven men, some wearing fancy dress, in Glasgow early on Sunday.
Police said the men, aged 31 and 33, were punched and kicked by the group on Renfield Street at about 03:15.
One of the attackers was wearing a green Robin Hood-type hat with a red feather at the left-hand side. 
Another was wearing what police described as blonde &quot;Heidi-type&quot; wig with plaits on either side.
The attack took place close to the junction at Renfield Lane in the city centre.
The group ran off towards Buchanan Street Bus Station where they took a black taxi.
The two victims received hospital treatment for &quot;lacerations&quot; to their heads.
The suspects were described as white, Scottish, late 20s or early 30s, medium build with one man being of heavy build.
Four men wore dark tops and jeans, one was wearing a yellow t-shirt and another was wearing a white cardigan with dark sleeves. 
Det Con David Copeland said: &quot;This was an unprovoked attack on two men by a much larger group which has left the victims with serious injuries. 
&quot;This type of activity on what seems to be a night out cannot be tolerated. We seek the assistance of the public in tracking down those responsible.&quot;
He said he was particularly keen to trace the driver of the taxi who picked up five of the suspects - including the suspects in costume - from a taxi rank at Buchanan Street Bus Station.
