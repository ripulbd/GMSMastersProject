CRAIG WHYTE, the former Rangers owner, faces being sent to prison for failing to attend a string of High Court hearings in London Craig Whyte facing prison over court absences CRAIG WHYTE, the former Rangers owner, faces being sent to prison for failing to attend a string of High Court hearings in London.

Whyte has been threatened with up to 28 days in jail if he fails to attend a court date on September 29 after having absent for hearings held in May and July.
According to a ruling by Mr Justice Arnold, Whyte “seeks to frustrate the court’s orders” over his involvement in a legal dispute with Ticketus, the firm that successfully sought legal action against Whyte, who was forced to hand over nearly &pound;20 million in damages.
Sky Sports News report that a transcript from the judge’s ruling shows Ticketus’ legal representatives attempting to contact the former Rangers owner without success, leaving texts and voicemails to a number known to have been used by Whyte.
In the ruling, Mr Justice Arnold wrote: “It seems to me to be clear from the evidence that the first defendant has adopted a policy of evading service and failing to communicate with the claimants’ solicitors, and in those ways it appears he seeks to frustrate the court’s orders. It seems to me that the order should be for committal for 28 days suspended upon the usual basis.”
