AN outbreak of salmonella is being linked to the hospitality section at Celtic Park, according to health officials Salmonella outbreak linked to Celtic hospitality AN outbreak of salmonella is being linked to the hospitality section at Celtic Park, according to health officials.

Eleven cases are being looked into by the public health protection arm of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGCC). 
All individuals affected had eaten at the club’s hospitality facilities on Sunday September 21.
One person who had an existing health condition spent a short period of time in hospital and has since been discharged, while the others were described as recovering at home.
Environmental Health officers visited the premises and said that they were satisfied that the food production processes at Celtic Park were appropriate.
The food business operator concerned is co-operating fully with the probe.
Dr Gillian Penrice, chief consultant in public health medicine at NHSGCC said: “The incubation period for salmonella is usually between 24 to 72 hours, meaning that the likelihood of any new cases linked to this situation is small.
“All 11 cases are recovering at home and our investigations into the source are continuing.
“I would stress, however, that this appears to have been an isolated cluster of cases, that there is no ongoing risk to customers and that we are satisfied with the food handling and hygiene at Celtic Park.”
The investigation is currently centred on outside suppliers of ingredients, but the Food Standards Agency has said that there are no other related salmonella incidents that they are aware of. 
Salmonella is a group of bacteria that can cause diarrhoea, with infections usually resolving within seven days.
