Ginger Baker pays tribute to Jack Bruce RENOWNED drummer Ginger Baker has paid tribute to "one-off" Cream bandmate Jack Bruce who has died at 71.Ginger, who is just as famous for his drumming as his wild exploits, said that he first thought that the news of Jack's death was a hoax because he has himself been reported dead before.Jack, Ginger and Eric Clapton's short-lived but highly influential 1960s super group Cream scored hits with classic tracks such as Sunshine of Your Love, I Feel Free and White Room.Jack wrote and sang most of the songs, in addition to playing bass guitar.Speaking from a hotel in the Republic of Ireland, Ginger, 75, said: &quot;We go back a long way, I called him Wee Jack. It's a big loss to the world and I'm very sad.&quot;I found out yesterday when my daughter phoned me. My first reaction was that it was a hoax because I have been reported dead so many times myself, but then it became reality.&quot;It was quite a while since I last spoke to him but he was a one-off, his approach to music made him special.&quot;My feeling is with his wife Margrit and his kids.&quot;Jack, who was born in Bishopbriggs, died on Saturday from liver disease at home in Suffolk.Baker said he had still not had a chance to speak to Clapton but was hoping to attend the funeral.It was Baker who initially asked Bruce to form a trio with Clapton, who in turn insisted that Bruce would be the singer.
