IT’S been Scotland’s biggest, longest and most expensive election battle.
And today the polls have opened and votes will be cast … and history will be made.
Here is a timeline of how the next two days will unfold:
7:00am: Polling stations around Scotland opened. There are 4.2million people registered to vote, 97% of the electorate.
10:00pm: Polls close. Ballot boxes are sealed and sent to 32 counts. Results from each centre will be sent to the chief counting officer at the Royal Highland Centre, in Ingliston, near Edinburgh, for verification and official announcement.

2:00am: Declarations begin with the smaller population centres expected to declare first and cities around 5am. Bad weather may delay counts.
Eilean Siar, North Lanarkshire, Inverclyde, Orkney, East Lothian, and Perth &amp; Kinross and Moray. Total voters 660,144 or 15.1% of the electorate.
The winner will be declared once either yes or no goes over 50% of the total votes cast.

2:30am: Clackmannanshire expected to declare. Total voters 42,109 or 1% of the electorate.
3:00am: Dumfries &amp; Galloway, East Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Falkirk, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, Aberdeenshire, Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire, Angus, Dundee City. Total voters 1,403,985, 32.1% of the electorate. Nearly half the votes will have been counted at this point in the evening.
