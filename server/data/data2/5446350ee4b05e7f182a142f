Return of the terrapin terror: charity fears over new Ninja Turtles film The Scottish SPCA is warning people to think carefully before taking on terrapins following a recent abandonment.Scotland's animal welfare charity was alerted on Monday, October 13 when a young boy discovered two large terrapins dumped in a box in a park in Carntyne, Glasgow.The incident has sparked fears that more people will be tempted into buying the reptiles on the back of the release of the latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film.Scottish SPCA Superintendent Sharon Comrie remembers the effect the original Ninja Turtles film had on their rehoming centres in 1990.She said: &quot;There was certainly a noticeable rise in the numbers coming into our care after the craze of the first film.&quot;Unfortunately many of the animals stayed with us for a very long time before being offered new homes.&quot;People are often fooled into thinking that terrapins are easy to look after and don't fully consider the time and commitment required to care for them.&quot;There can also be a boredom factor with terrapins because owners can't take them for a walk or cuddle and play with them.&quot;Terrapins can live for up to 60 years so the decision to take one on shouldn't be made lightly.&quot;The Scottish SPCA has seen 86 terrapins arrive in their care since the start of the year and is urging potential owners to do their research and make sure they have the appropriate equipment to look after them.Superintendent Comrie added: &quot;Once you factor in the cost of the purchase and set up, electricity, feeding and care you are looking at quite a costly pet.&quot;Terrapins can be bought cheaply from pet shops when they are the size of a fifty pence piece and look very cute. But often people don't realise that they can grow up to 20 inches long.&quot;Some buyers also don't appreciate the level of cleaning and care required to keep an exotic creature in healthy condition.&quot;Currently we are caring for over 60 terrapins and it's a real shame because, with the right owners, they can make excellent pets and provide hours of enjoyment.&quot;We are encouraging genuine exotics enthusiasts to visit our centres and offer good, knowledgeable homes to these wonderful animals.&quot;Anyone interested in rehoming or finding out more about terrapins can call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999.
