 Stenhousemuir came from behind to beat Greenock Morton in Scottish League One. 
 The visitors moved into the lead when Declan McManus poked in Sean Crighton's cross for his fifth goal of the season. 
 Their advantage barely lasted a minute as midfielder Sean Dickson's square ball across the six-yard box allowed Martin Grehan to finish comfortably. 
 Dickson rose highest to nod in Gary Oliver's cross in the second period and McManus almost levelled when his shot hit the post late on.
