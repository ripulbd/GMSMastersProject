MYSTERIOUS GIRL singer Andre speaks with Bev Lyons after his gig at the Clyde Auditorium. Video: Peter Andre on cooking haggis and going Taps Aff at Glasgow gig - Daily Record 
PETER Andre and his big band serenaded the crowd with The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond during his Scots gig last night.
The singer who was on stage with his brother Chris for his Big Night gig didn’t hold back as he entertained the mostly female crowd at Glasgow’s Armadillo with hits of his own and others including Happy, Mysterious Girl and Flava.
As well as traditional Greek dancing with some extremely willing participants up on stage, and an early rendition of his forthcoming Christmas single complete with santa hat, the singer joked about his musical career - and four number ones that he claimed no-one could remember.
The only thing missing was his six pack but he teased the audience it could be a night of ‘Taps Aff’.

Peter played The Daily Record some unreleased tracks off his forthcoming Christmas album and told Bev before the show: “I have learned a lot about Glasgow and somebody gave me uncooked haggis so we have got to cook it and apparently its very spicy. She knows how much I love cooking. It’s going to knock my socks off.”
Peter, who left Glasgow’s Crowne Plaza hotel at 5am to jump on his tour bus to Manchester. also wished us luck on our hunt for Lady Gaga today.
He said: “I was on a red carpet once trying to interview George Clooney and I couldn’t get his attention. I was told to throw something at him but I just couldn’t do it and I ended up missing my big chance. Say hi to Gaga from me if you get her.”
