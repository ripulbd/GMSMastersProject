Ferry cost to Arran cut using road equivalent tariff scheme The cost of ferry travel to the Isle of Arran has been cut substantially with the introduction of a government-backed scheme to reduce fares.
The road equivalent tariff (RET) allows fares to be realigned with the equivalent cost of travelling by road.
From Monday, the cost of a return car journey from Brodick in Arran to Ardrossan in North Ayrshire will be &pound;29.70 - down from &pound;70.
Passenger-only return journeys will cost &pound;7.30 - a saving of &pound;4.
Kenneth Gibson, the SNP MSP for Cunningham North, which includes Arran and Ardrossan, said the introduction of RET was &quot;great news for tourists and for islanders&quot;.
He said: &quot;Arran is a spectacular destination and I have every confidence that the roll-out of the ferry RET will help make life easier for islanders - many of whom travel back and forth to the mainland on a regular basis - and make the island less expensive and therefore even more appealing and accessible to tourists than it is already.&quot;
Arran is served by ferry from Ardrossan or Claonaig in Kintyre, Argyll and Bute.
