The 31-year-old male victim was attacked in Victoria Road, near to the Queen's Park Railway Station, at about 18:30 on Monday 26 May.
A member of the public stopped to assist the victim. The suspect then made off towards Queen's Park. 
Police Scotland said the man in the CCTV images may be able to help with their investigation.
He is described as white, aged late 30s to early 40s, 5ft 7in tall, of medium build and with brown hair.
He was wearing a light jumper, dark trousers or jeans and white trainers. 
Det Con Peter McFarlane, of Police Scotland, said: &quot;We've issued the image of this man, as we believe he may have information which could assist with our inquiries. 
&quot;There seems to be absolutely no reason for the assault - which was severe enough to require stitches. 
&quot;The suspect was walking along Victoria Road from the Queens Park end of the road. It was still quite early in the evening and it was a bank holiday so it would have been quite busy at that time of the day with plenty people milling about. 
Det Con McFarlane added: &quot;We know that a man - a member of the public - stopped to help the injured man and pushed the suspect away before he ran off towards Queens Park. 
&quot;We are keen to speak to this man as he may have information that will help us catch the attacker.&quot;
