Manager Ronny Deila 'not worried' by Celtic form  Manager Ronny Deila still believes Celtic are &quot;progressing&quot; despite suffering their second Scottish Premiership defeat of the season. 
 Ali Crawford's strike gave Hamilton Academical their first win at Celtic Park since 1938. 
 &quot;I'm not worried at all,&quot; said Norwegian Deila. &quot;When you have 10 to 15 chances, you have played quite well. 
 &quot;With so many chances, you should win the game, no question. But of course you need to put the ball in the net.&quot; 
 Celtic dominated the first half and had several opportunities to equalise, including two headed chances for Anthony Stokes. 
 &quot;Sometimes football is like that,&quot; Deila said. 
 &quot;It's a very disappointing day. We had a lot of chances and didn't score one goal so that's unbelievably disappointing. 
 &quot;If we had done that we would've won the game quite easily, with so many chances you should win games. 
 &quot;We need determination to really want to get the ball into the net and today we had more to go in that. A little bit too sloppy, we need more accuracy and more determination. 
 &quot;To lose at home is nothing we want. We have to turn this around and bounce back next match. Still we are into everything and have opportunities to make a very good season. 
Celtic failed to score at home in a domestic match for the first time in over a year as Hamilton triumphed at Celtic Park
 &quot;I should hope there was a game in three days but now we have to wait 13 days to bounce back against Ross County.&quot; 
 Supporters were vocal in their disapproval at the final whistle but Deila said: &quot;I understand that. 
 &quot;We have to win games and today we didn't win and we should've done it. With those chances, you shouldn't lose games.&quot;
