Judge details Whyte failings A JUDGE who banned former Rangers owner Craig Whyte from being a company director for 15 years said his conduct of the business was "characterised by dishonesty".Lord Tyre's written opinion has been issued following his decision to impose a maximum ban on Whyte at the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this week.Whyte, 43, became a director at Rangers in 2011 but it went into administration the following year before being wound up.Lord Tyre said: &quot;Immediately upon his appointment as a director or Rangers the respondent (Whyte) caused Rangers to enter into the Ticketus agreement, for the sole or main purpose of facilitating his acquisition of Rangers by providing finance which was lent by Rangers to Wavetower, which in turn used it to repay Rangers' external debt, notably to Lloyds Banking Group.&quot;In effect, a significant proportion to Rangers' prospective income for the next three years was used to pay the bank and thus to fund the respondent's acquisition of the club.&quot;A further issue was the failure of Rangers under Whyte's ownership to meet its obligations to HMRC over PAYE, national insurance and VAT.Lord Tyre said: &quot;Acting to the exclusion of other directors, the respondent caused Rangers to stop making payment when due in respect of these liabilities from September 7 2011.&quot;By February 2012, when HMRC presented its petition for an administration order, a sum of around &pound;10.5 million had accrued in respect of unpaid tax and unapplied interest.
