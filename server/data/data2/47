A COUPLE were terrorised in their own home after being targeted by armed men. Balloch couple face "traumatic" ordeal after armed men turn up at their home A COUPLE were terrorised in their own home after being targeted by armed men.At around 11pm on Tuesday a 56-year-old woman was faced with a man carrying a gun after she answered the door to her Balloch home.The man forced his way into the home in Buchanan Avenue, Haldane, knocking the woman over in the process.Her 63-year-old husband, who had been upstairs, came down and was confronted by the armed man and his accomplice who had also entered their house.A struggle took place and the man also fell.Both suspects fled the house empty handed. They made off in a white car.The couple were not physically injured but were left &quot;very distressed&quot; by their ordeal.Police said at this time there was no description available of the suspects other than white males.Detective Chief Inspector Calum Young is appealing for witnesses. He said: &quot;This was obviously a very traumatic experience for this couple. At this time we have yet to establish a motive but believe that, for whatever reason, the couple were the intended targets.&quot;Door to door inquiries are continuing in the area and everything is being done to trace those responsible.&quot;Police are checking if a stolen car, which was found burnt out in Gartocharn, is connected to the incident.Mr Young said: &quot;On Wednesday October 1, a white coloured Mercedes motor car was found burnt out near Woodend Lodge, Gartocharn. This car had been stolen from Stepps on July 19 2014. Inquiries are ongoing to clarify whether this could have been the white car used in the attempted robbery.&quot;He has appealed for anyone who was in the Buchanan Avenue area on Tuesday who saw a white car they did not recognise or any suspicious behaviour to come forward.He added: &quot;I would also ask anyone who saw the Mercedes in Gartocharn on Wednesday or any activity at or near Woodend Lodge to come forward.&quot;Any person with information which could assist in this investigation is asked to telephone the CID at Dumbarton on the non emergency telephone number 101. Alternatively Crimestoppers can be called on 0800 555 111.
