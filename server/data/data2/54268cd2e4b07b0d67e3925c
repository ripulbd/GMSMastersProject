 Motherwell welcome Stuart Carswell back from suspension as they aim to avenge Wednesday's League Cup defeat. 
 Steven Hammell could be on the bench but he is not fit to start while Craig Moore remains sidelined. 
 Hamilton are hopeful over returns from injury for striker Mickael Antoine-Currier and defender Jesus Garcia Tena. 
 Defender Martin Canning is also back in training and will be assessed on Saturday morning but midfielder Darian MacKinnon is suspended. 
  Motherwell manager Stuart McCall:  &quot;We will make a lot of changes for Saturday, there's no doubt about that. There were a lot of people running on empty and a few were carrying injuries late on. 
 &quot;We will reassess it but one thing we can't do is start feeling sorry for ourselves. We have got to start climbing the league and getting points on board. 
 &quot;We will be up against a rejuvenated Hamilton again and they have proved why they are up there, because they are very hard to break down, well-disciplined and well-marshalled, and on that surface we find it hard to create and score goals. 
 &quot;But we are at Fir Park on Saturday and we have to make sure we are ready.&quot; 
  Hamilton player-manager Alex Neil:  &quot;I am not a big fan of playing a team so close to the first game against them. 
 &quot;I am hoping the second one isn't a tousy game. Nobody wants to give anything away so it can be a stalemate. 
 &quot;I hope for the fans' sake that is not the case. You want an end-to-end match. 
 &quot;We will give it our best shot to try to win the match. 
 &quot;Motherwell will do the same and they will be looking to correct what happened the other night. 
 &quot;But if we can beat them again, it will be great for the fans.&quot;
