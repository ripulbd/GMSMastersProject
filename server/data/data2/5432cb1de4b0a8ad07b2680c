SCOTLAND is blessed with an exceptional natural larder stemming from the clear waters and fertile farmland that produces some of the best food and drink in the world. 


Scottish Food &amp; Drink Fortnight celebrates our finest wares and showcases the fantastic produce available throughout the country. Running now until 21 September, the Fortnight includes events all over the country, from farmers’ markets and food and drink festivals to foraging days and farm tours.
This week’s video takes a look the delicious bites on offer at the Loch Lomond Food &amp; Drink Festival - one of the many fantastic events taking place over the course of the Fortnight.
Set on the bonny banks of Loch Lomond, the festival attracts around 20,000 people to the area to enjoy a feast of food and drink over two days in a beautiful setting. 
This year the festival welcomed Great British Bake Off star James Morton who offered guests some top tips during his baking demonstrations. Visitors also had the opportunity to learn some home cooking secrets from local experts. 
New for this year, the festival launched the LOCHtoberfest, where a choice of over 30 locally brewed ales were available for visitors to enjoy throughout the festival.
