STEVEN has spent the last 21 months building a virtual version of the city block by block. Game fan Steven, 15, is recreating the entire city of Glasgow - in Minecraft - Daily Record MINECRAFT fan Steven Browning is rebuilding the entire city of Glasgow in the video game.
He has spent the last 21 months recreating the city block by block in virtual form.
Fittingly, the game’s central character is a builder called Steve.
Steven, 15, has started work on 293 buildings and 103 of them have full interiors. He plans to kit them all out properly.
His first project was the block in Petershill where he was brought up. He has also put up the hospital where he was born, Rottenrow.
And he has built the landmark Red Road flats – the city’s tallest buildings. Steven said: “I think it’s wrong that they are being demolished.”
He takes great pains to get his city, with its winding roads and tenements, right.
He told BuzzFeed News: “I use building plans to copy the floor plans and Google Earth to measure the external wall sizes.
“Sometimes I may give a building its planned future look.
“For example, five 15-storey apartment buildings in the Wyndford area are currently being refurbished, which involves placing overcladding on to the buildings.”
He spends up to five hours a day on the game. But he said: “I think I’m going slower than I could.”
After he has completed Glasgow, he plans to turn his attention to Cumbernauld, Motherwell and Paisley.
And then it’s on to Edinburgh.
