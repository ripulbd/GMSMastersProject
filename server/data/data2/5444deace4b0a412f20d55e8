 The Buddies were beaten 1-0 at home by 10-man Inverness on Saturday and have now lost all of their league games at St Mirren Park this term. 
 &quot;It's been the same story this season at home, we've had enough of the ball but we can't seem to get it in the back of the net at home,&quot; Craig said. 
 &quot;There wasn't enough guile about us in terms of creating chances.&quot; 
 Greg Tansey scored the Caley winner from the penalty spot after Marc McAusland was judged to have fouled Billy McKay, before the visitors had Ryan Christie sent off for a second booking. 
 &quot;I know the fans will walk away from here frustrated and disappointed and, in some cases angry, because we've had so much of the ball,&quot; Craig added. 
 &quot;And the old 10 v 11 raises its head. It's always more difficult than people would expect to play against 10 men. 
 &quot;If you are down to 10 men it galvanises you as a team and that was the case with Caley. Man for man they put themselves right on the line for their team today. 
 &quot;Having had so much of the ball it's disappointing that we didn't carve out any real glaring opportunities. We had one or two half-chances and a couple of clearances in and around their box, but overall we didn't make enough of the extra man. 
 &quot;I've got no comment to make about the referee, I don't see the point. The reaction of both sets of players [to the penalty] was 'what's happened?' So both sets of players showed they didn't know what had actually happened so that says it all.&quot;
