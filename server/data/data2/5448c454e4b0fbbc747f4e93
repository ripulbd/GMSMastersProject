Accused told cop he was a champ boxer A murder accused told an off-duty cop who found him standing over an unconscious man he was "the heavyweight boxing champion of Glasgow," a court was told.PC Garey Thomson was giving evidence at the trial of Luke Quinn, 33, who denies murdering Simon Richardson, 45, in Wellington Street, Glasgow, on November 10 last year.He told prosecutor Allan Nicol that he was heading home after a night out when out of the corner of his eye he saw Quinn stamping on an unconscious man.PC Thomson told the jury at the High Court in Glasgow: &quot;It was a stamp, but it wasn't full force. I walked straight across the road to stop any further attack.&quot;He said the man on the ground was unconscious and the other man said his name was Luke Quinn. PC Thomson added: &quot;I asked him what had happened and he told me that the man lying on the ground had tried to rob him and was trying to go through his pockets.He then said: 'Are you going to rob me, mate?'&quot;He added: 'I was heavyweight boxing champion of Glasgow.' he was getting more aggressive and agitated about me being there.&quot;Asked by defence QC Donald Findlay if he thought the comment about being boxing champion of Glasgow was a rational one, he replied: &quot;No, I though it was a bit strange. I thought he was trying to get me to go away.&quot;PC Thomson said he stayed with the injured man until an ambulance arrived. It is alleged Quinn punched Mr Richardson, of Paisley, on the head, stamped and kicked his head and body, rifled through his pockets and repeatedly punched him, whereby he was so badly injured he later died.Quinn has lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.The trial continues.
