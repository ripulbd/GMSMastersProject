Partick Thistle: Alan Archibald peeved at St Mirren free-kick  Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald was left frustrated by refereeing decisions in the lead up to St Mirren's winning penalty at Firhill. 
 Kenny McLean's free-kick led to a hand ball offence against Abdul Osman in the closing stages as St Mirren won 2-1. 
 &quot;Conrad Balatoni has went for a header, won it and they've given a foul - I've no idea why,&quot; said Archibald. 
 &quot;And big Ab has gone to shut down the rebound. He's a yard away and he blasts it off him.&quot; 
 Archibald thought it was harsh on Osman to be penalised by referee Willie Collum. 
 &quot;They say his arms should be down, but it's only natural that the arms go up,&quot; the Thistle manager told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;Some you get, some you don't and I'm more disappointed with the free-kick leading up to it. 
 &quot;That was the pattern of the second half. Silly fouls given that weren't fouls.&quot; 
 Archibald insisted that his side had not taken St Mirren lightly despite the visitors arriving without a point in five Scottish Premiership games. 
 &quot;The boys took the warning and in the first half were very, very good,&quot; he said. 
 “We don't want plaudits for playing well. We want plaudits for playing well and winning the game” 
 &quot;If we took our chances, it would have been a different game I think, especially the chances after we scored. 
 &quot;I thought, after the first five minutes, we were the better team. 
 &quot;I thought we controlled the midfield and scored a good goal and we had chances after that and didn't take them. 
 &quot;We don't want plaudits for playing well. We want plaudits for playing well and winning the game - we need to combine them both.&quot;
