Michael McCann, 50, allegedly confronted a 17-year-old boy and his friend as the pair campaigned for Yes Scotland in his East Kilbride constituency.
It is believed that the schoolboy’s father made a complaint to the police after the incident.
Mr McCann, who said he was “absolutely delighted” with the result of the referendum last month, is said to have made counter allegations against his accusers.
Mr McCann is the chairman of the group of Scottish Labour MPs at Westminster.
A police spokesman said a 50-year-old man had been reported to the Procurator Fiscal.
