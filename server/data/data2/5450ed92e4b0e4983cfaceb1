Armed robber caught on CCTV after holding up village store at his home village of Kelloholm. Kelloholm village store held up at knifepoint by armed robber - Daily Record An armed robber apologised after holding up a village store at knifepoint, a court was told yesterday.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that 31-year-old Andrew Whiteford went into the store in his home village of Kelloholm and bought a yoghurt.
When the 35-year-old shop assistant started to give him his change Whiteford said: “Put the money in the bag,”
At first she thought he meant his change, but then he said: “No, the money in the till. I’m robbing ya.” and pointed a knife at her.
She put cash into a bag and handed it to Whiteford who said: “I’m sorry about that,” as he left.
In court he admitted an armed raid at Nith Valley Co-op, Nith Buildings, Kelloholm, on August 16 and taking &pound;300.42 in cash.
The court heard that Whiteford had three previous convictions for assault and robbery.
Advocate depute Lisa Gillespie, prosecuting, said: “The accused carried out an offence in 2011 in the same store.”
The incident was caught on CCTV and Whiteford was arrested the following day. Initially he denied any involvement but then confessed to police and showed him where he had thrown away the knife.
Judge Lord Uist deferred sentence on Whiteford until January next year and ordered a risk assessment of the danger he presents to the public.
