 Adam Morgan is suspended for St Johnstone's Scottish Premiership meeting with Kilmarnock on Saturday. 
 Midfielders Scott Brown and Chris Millar are back in training but remain doubts while Steven MacLean and Tam Scobbie are still out. 
 Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston may not risk Craig Samson after the goalkeeper recovered from a broken toe. 
 Chris Chantler and Rory McKenzie, meanwhile, could return to the team following minor injuries in Perth. 
  St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright:  &quot;I am looking for an improvement from everybody. 
 &quot;They all realise we can do better, that they are good players and a good team, but they are in one of those little runs at the minute that only ourselves can get out of. 
 &quot;They are hurting and disappointed that we have lost the last four and that is the way it should be.&quot; 
  Kilmarnock midfielder Chris Johnston on  the club's bonus dispute  :  &quot;It won't have an impact on what we do on the park. 
 &quot;Things have been going on behind closed doors for a wee while but we have still been going out and getting results. 
 &quot;It's not been affecting us in terms of results. We are just concentrating on winning games and moving up the table because that is all we can do.&quot;
