An increasing number of Scots are living for more than a century, according to new figures. More Scots reaching 100-year mark An increasing number of Scots are living for more than a century, according to new figures.There were estimated to be 850 people in Scotland who reached the 100-year milestone in 2013, up from 530 a decade earlier.The vast majority were women, who accounted for 720 (85%) of Scotland's centenarians.Figures show that while more men are living into their 90s, almost three-quarters (72%) of people aged 90 to 99 are women.National Records of Scotland estimated the number of centenarians using information from the 2011 census.Chief executive Tim Ellis said: &quot;In 2013 there were 18 male centenarians per hundred female centenarians, an increase from 13 in 2003, indicating a narrowing of the gap in mortality between men and women for this age group.&quot;Estimates of the number of people aged 90 to 99 show relatively big increases between 2010 and 2012.&quot;This is partly due to births in the years following the First World War being much higher than in the preceding years.&quot;The number of births in 1920 was the highest since the introduction of national registration in 1855.&quot;Experts attribute the rise in the number of centenarians to increased survival rates as the result of improvements in hygiene, sanitation, medical treatment, housing and general living standards.
