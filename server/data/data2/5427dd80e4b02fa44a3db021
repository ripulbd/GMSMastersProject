The 32-year-old is in a stable condition at Glasgow Western Infirmary.
A 52-year-old man also suffered cuts to his head. Officers said witnesses claimed the disturbance was caused by teenagers who ran off after the attack.
Police said the fight spilled out onto the road and a number of vehicles had to swerve to avoid it.
The street was busy with members of the public and a double-decker bus also passed the scene. 
Det Sgt Alan Cuthbert said: &quot;We are still conducting door-to-door enquires and we have considerable CCTV footage to review.
&quot;What we do understand at this stage, is that these men have been assaulted without any sort of provocation.&quot;
