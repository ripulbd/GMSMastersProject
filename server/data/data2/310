Intercity drug gang is jailed Members of an organised crime gang who were caught transporting drugs and money between two major Scots cities have been jailed.William Anderson, 26, Stephen Wilson, 41, Daniel Jebb, 64, and Robert Maxwell, 57, were caught by police probing links between hoodlums in Glasgow and Dundee.Detectives also arrested Leon Bruce, 40, and Jordan Mitchell, 24, during their intelligence-led probe.The High Court in Edinburgh heard how the six men were involved in a racket which saw Glasgow-based drug dealers supply their Tayside counterparts with thousands of pounds worth of heroin.The facts emerged following a hearing before judge Lord Boyd earlier this year.Anderson, of Arklay Street, Dundee; Wilson, of Step Row, Dundee; Jebb, of Balglass Avenue, Glasgow; Maxwell, of Formby Drive, Glasgow; Bruce, of Tullideph Road, Dundee; and Mitchell, of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty earlier this year to drugs supply and money laundering charges.Sentence had been deferred until yesterday in order for the court to obtain reports about their character.The offences took place between May and August 2013.Lord Boyd jailed Anderson for three years. Wilson was jailed for three years, three months and Jebb for two years and four months.Maxwell was jailed for five years and 219 days. The judge deferred sentence on Bruce - who was a minor player in the scam - for a year in order for him to be of good behaviour.Mitchell, another minor player in the racket, was handed a 240 hour community service sentence.Passing sentence, Lord Boyd told the six men: &quot;The supply of illegal drugs - particularly class A drugs - is an evil and vile trade.&quot;It blights communities and the lives of individuals, as you well know.&quot;
