Police said a group of at least ten youths in their mid-to-late teens spilled out onto the road in Saracen Street at around 7pm on Friday.
Vehicles had to swerve to avoid members of the group, who later ran off.
The 32-year-old suffered damage to his lung and is in a stable condition at Glasgow Western Infirmary. 
Detective Sergeant Alan Cuthbert said: “We are conducting door-to-door enquires and we have considerable CCTV footage to review. What we do understand at this stage is that these men have been assaulted without any sort of provocation. I am keen for anyone who observed the incident to come forward, particularly any drivers who would have observed the incident up close.”
