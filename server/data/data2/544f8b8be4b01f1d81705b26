Swimming star Ross Murdoch was back in Stirling on Friday to meet a pint-sized superfan. Swimming with a star - Daily Record Balfron boy Ross, who has just returned from swimming’s European Championships in Germany, took to the pool at his training base at Stirling University with five-year-old Brian Fitzpatrick.
The Glasgow 2014 gold medallist launched an appeal to meet Brian after he received a letter from him after his Games triumph.
Brian, from Dumbarton, toured the National Swimming Academy before joining Ross for a superstar swimming lesson.
Proud dad Bruce Fitzpatrick said: “It’s been a fantastic day. Brian is absolutely over the moon to meet Ross.”
Brian – who has just started school last week - scrawled his very own note to the 200m breaststroke gold medal winner following Ross’s success in the pool.
It still reached the swimmer despite being only addressed to “Ross Murdoch, Commonwealth Champion, Balloch”.
Bruce said: “We spotted the address, but let Brian send it off pretty sure it would still reach Ross. He’s one of the most famous people in Scotland.
“We also thought he’d get lots of fan mail and wouldn’t hear any more.”
Ross then tweeted: “RT&amp;help me find 5yo Brian who sent me this amazing letter! I’d love to meet him and show him around where I train :-).”
Brian’s father later spotted the tweet and got in touch through the social networking site.
