THE community activity group helped spruce up the ash pitch in the park, and they also hope to start sporting competitions there. Glasgow's Kelvingrove Park football pitch gets cleaned up thanks to ASAP volunteers - Daily Record A WEST end football park has been given a new lease on life thanks to a team of volunteers.
They spent a day cleaning up an ash pitch in Kelvingrove Park in a bid to get more kids active.
Organised by community group After School Activities Programme, it is hoped the restoration efforts will see pupils from the area’s Hillhead High make use of the pitch.
ASAP founder Stephen Koepplinger said his ultimate goal was to see teens use the facility for sporting competitions.
The sports and healthy living campaigner also said he hoped the initiative would act as a pilot that would be replicated across Glasgow.
Stephen added: “The clean up went well. We had six volunteers.
“The pitch was in a decent shape before we arrived, with it being a level and clean surface.&nbsp;Our efforts were to take away some of the grass that had encroached on the pitch.”
ASAP sought permission from Glasgow City Council to carry out the clean-up.
Stephen added: “We have already got some great work going in Cadder but are looking for other groups to join in so that competitions can be arranged.&nbsp;
“The ARC in Milton is another location that we are hoping to be able to reclaim the disused football pitch so that community games can be undertaken.&nbsp;
“That would make three red ash football pitches that could all be working together to get more community games sorted.
&quot;Sport is a force for good. If you sort out teenage boredom it’ll reduce violence on the streets, as well as the obvious health benefits.”
