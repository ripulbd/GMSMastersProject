Union boss stands firm over steel plants sale A union leader has repeated his opposition to the proposed sale of two Scottish steel plants near Glasgow as dozens of shop stewards from sites across the UK were due to attend an emergency summit in London.Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, was responding to comments from David Cameron while preparations are made for talks between the unions and the chairman of Tata Steel today.The latest developments come a week after Indian multi-national Tata Steel anounced plans to sell its Europe long products division to Swiss industrialists.Due diligence, which could take up to six months, is now being carried out by the Geneva-based Klesch Group.The Dalzell Plate Mill at Motherwell and the Clydebridge Steelworks in Cambuslang, which employ around 400 workers between them, form part of the proposed multi-billion pound deal which includes distribution centres acoss the UK, France and Germany as well as a number of steel plants in other parts of Britain.Former Ravenscraig steelworker Frank Roy, the Labour MP for Motherwell and Wishaw, asked David Cameron during Prime Minister's Questions what he thought of the potential buyer.The PM insisted it was important to judge Klesch Group &quot;by words and actions&quot; although added his government will do what it can to save jobs in the steel indusry while also looking at carbon levies.Mr Rickhuss issued a video soon after in which he said: &quot;The Prime Minister's comments will give no definitive reassurance to the thousands of our members whose futures are under threat.&quot;Community remains unconvinced of the need to sell off the long products business and we'll be doing everything we can to ensure our members are protected.&quot;He also welcomed a pledge by Tata Steel chairman Cyrus Mistry to sit down with the steel unions next month.gordon.thomson@eveningtimes.co.uk
