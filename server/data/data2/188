The 2014 Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run took over Glasgow on Sunday as runners competed in the half-marathon and 10k races.
An estimated 30,000 participants took part in various events over the weekend, including legendary runner Haile Gebrselassie, who unfortunately had to pull out due to breathing difficulties.
After the race, many runners embraced our Record of the Moment, &nbsp;and headed to our special social media booth at the finish line in Glasgow Green.
Enjoy the images in the gallery above as the runners show of their smiles following the race.
If you took part in the race today, you could send us your tweets and pictures direct to our Facebook page or to our Twitter using the hashtag&nbsp; #ROTM
