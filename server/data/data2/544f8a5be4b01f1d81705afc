The pair, alongside another top swimmer from the club, Graeme Lyons were given the awards from their former West Dunbartonshire Amateur Swimming Club (WDASC) in honour of their Commonwealth swimmers.
Graeme and Rory joined the current members of the club at their championship at the weekend to present the medals.
After receiving the award Rory posted on Facebook: “Big thanks to WDASC for the lifetime membership award and the hip flask. Always grateful for the support I received before, during and after Glasgow 2014.”
 

The club championship was a great success and was the first time many of the young swimmers have taken part in a competitive event.
Spectators gathered over the two-day event, which took place from 4-5 October, and they were treated to an excellent display — with four club records being broken.
Head coach, Jimmy Orr said: “The swimmers at the championship were phenomenal.
“They showed tremendous skill and many swam huge confidence boosting swims.
“We also watched four club records being broken which is really encouraging for the future.”
Club members also went head to head with coach Jimmy and, after an intense race, the coach emerged victorious.
Jimmy was delighted to be declared the winner and added: “Finally, proving yet again that we know best, coaches winning the head to head race.
“We’ll need to have a rematch next year .”
