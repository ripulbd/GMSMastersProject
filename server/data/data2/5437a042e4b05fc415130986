A GLASGOW hospital was in "crisis" after emergency patients, including OAPs, were left for up to 17 hours on trolleys in cold corridors because of a bed shortage. Staff say city hospital is at 'breaking point' A GLASGOW hospital was in "crisis" after emergency patients, including OAPs, were left for up to 17 hours on trolleys in cold corridors because of a bed shortage.Staff and patients' groups told the Evening Times the Victoria Infirmary was in meltdown and the A&amp;E unit had to be closed to new admissions.Frustrated staff revealed that seven A&amp;E patients had been left on trolleys for between 12 and 17 hours, being fed only tea and toast while nurses struggled to find them beds.Last night, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde apologised to patients and blamed the chaos on a &quot;highly unusual surge&quot; in admissions on Wednesday night.Health chiefs admitted that &quot;lengthy waits experienced by some was suboptimal&quot; but deemed it &quot;inappropriate&quot; to transfer patients to other hospitals due to their medical conditions.They said two wards were already closed due to the norovirus but A&amp;E patients were moved as soon as beds became available.Robert Calderwood, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Chief Executive, said yesterday: &quot;I would like to apologise to those patients who experienced lengthy delays over the past 24 hours.&quot;The demands that the Victoria Infirmary experienced were highly unusual for this time of year and already having wards unable to admit new patient due to norovirus exacerbated the situation.&quot;As soon as beds became available this morning patients were transferred into ward areas.&quot;We have also now been able to utilise the beds in one of the wards not admitting new patients, as it has now been free of new norovirus cases for 48 hours.&quot;Last week we told of a young mum who was treated in a cubicle which had blood-spattered walls and discarded needle covers, tissues and a used gown on the floor at the same A&amp;E unit.Insiders insist there are staff and bed shortages because the hospital is being &quot;run down&quot; prior to its closure and the opening of the new South Glasgow Hospitals Campus, in Govan, next summer.One distressed A&amp;E worker said: &quot;This is the worst I've ever seen it. Something has got to be done. It is in crisis, at breaking point.&quot;There are no proper washing facilities either in A&amp;E, we have to use kidney dishes filled with water to clean the patients and there are no proper towels to dry them.&quot;Very importantly, other than tea and toast, there are no food making facilities.&quot;The Victoria has been gradually run down because we are going to the new super hospital next year.&quot;No one is dying because of it but the quality of care staff can give is atrocious.&quot;Scotland Patients Association executive director Dr Jean Turner described the situation as &quot;appalling&quot;.She said: &quot;It sounds like a crisis situation to me. I think this is appalling in 2014, this is not a third world country.&quot;To have patients on trolleys in corridors for hours being fed nothing but tea and toast is totally inappropriate.&quot;Royal College of Nursing senior officer Anne Thomson said she was aware of problems with staff levels and the lack of beds at the Victoria Hospital.She said: &quot;We received an anonymous letter from staff raising concerns about the Victoria Infirmary's A&amp;E staffing levels and staff being put under undue stress. These nurses are saying that patient care in A&amp;E can be compromised due to understaffing, particularly at night.&quot;janice.burns@eveningtimes.co.uk
