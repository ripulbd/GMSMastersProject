Alex Ferguson unveiled as Ryder Cup team's inspirational speaker Having attempted to keep a secret of his choice of inspirational speaker to his Ryder Cup team Paul McGinley discovered today that everyone knew it was Alex Ferguson except his players.Europe's Ryder Cup captain had revealed last week, during the Wales Open, that he had asked someone everyone would know to help him set the tone by speaking at tonight's team gathering, but said then that he did not want to announce who that was until after he had made his contribution.However after Fergie was spotted touring the facilities with Gordon Simpson, the Ryder Cup communications director, McGinley realised that the game was up.&quot;He had agreed to do it but he asked me to keep it quiet. I suppose going around here with Gordon isn't keeping it quiet and a lot of people have mentioned it to me,&quot; McGinley acknowledged, with a smile.McGinley explained that he had met Ferguson a few years ago at an event held by JP McManus, formerly one of Manchester United's major shareholders.&quot;We've met a number of times over the last few months,&quot; said McGinley.&quot;He's asked me a lot of questions about it and he's very keen and looking forward to it.&quot;The Irishman insisted, however, that Ferguson's involvement will not be a serious one in terms of the strategy for the week.&quot;This is not about him being the head teacher, this is about having fun and relating it to football,&quot; he said.
