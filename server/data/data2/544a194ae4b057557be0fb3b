The company launched its first local service, STV Glasgow, in June, and an Edinburgh channel is to go live in January.
Each station is run in partnership with local universities and colleges.
The broadcaster says the stations would deliver &quot;local news and current affairs content&quot; while helping media students train in a live TV environment. 
The Aberdeen application has been submitted in partnership with Robert Gordon University and North East Scotland College, the Dundee bid with Abertay University and Dundee and Angus College, and the Ayr proposal with the University of the West of Scotland.
Bobby Hain, director of channels at STV, said: &quot;We have demonstrated our ability to engage with local communities and deliver relevant, local content across STV's multi-platforms, including the current STV Glasgow licence and our apps serving Scotland's largest cities. 
&quot;STV believes that, working closely with our education partners, we can successfully deliver compelling services in these three additional areas across the 12-year licence.&quot;
STV Glasgow is run in partnership with Glasgow Caledonian University, and reaches a monthly audience of more than 500,000 people.
