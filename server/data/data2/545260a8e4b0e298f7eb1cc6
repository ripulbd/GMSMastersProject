He then tried to attack the man's friend before he made off.The 20-year-old was taken to the Western Infirmary and then transferred to the Southern General. He was released following treatment.The suspect is described as a white male in his late teens to early twenties. He is approximately 6ft to 6ft2ins tall and of skinny build. He was wearing a dark windproof jacket with a brand mark on the left chest. The hood was up and his face was partially obscured.Detective Inspector David Moran, who is investigating this attack, said: &quot;This is the second attack of this nature in the past few weeks but it is too early to say whether or not there is any connection between the incidents. The victim has still to be fully interviewed and a motive to be established.&quot;There is a possibility that the suspect got into a dark coloured vehicle after the attack but this has not been confirmed. I would appeal to anyone who was in the area of Orbiston Drive or Swallow Road after 7.15pm on Wednesday night and saw the attack to come forward. I would also ask anyone who recognises the description of the suspect to get in touch.&quot;This was a residential area and officers are conducting door to door enquiries. I would ask for the co-operation of the local community in helping identify the person responsible.&quot;Any person with information is asked to telephone the CID at Clydebank on the non emergency number 101.
