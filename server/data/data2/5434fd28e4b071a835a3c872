Ashley calls EGM in bid to shake up Rangers board Billionaire Mike Ashley has called for an extraordinary general meeting to force a shake-up of Rangers' board.The Sports Direct tycoon, who may now hold the key to the power battle at the Ibrox club, has called for the removal of chief executive Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors.A statement on the London Stock Exchange read: &quot;Mash (Ashley's personal investment company) requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company.&quot;The notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of the company.&quot;The company is currently verifying that the Notice is properly constituted.&quot;If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company's forthcoming Annual General Meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course.&quot;The Board is united in its support of the executive team.&quot;If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.&quot;Newcastle United owner Ashley strengthened his power base at Rangers last week.However, fans' groups have strongly criticised the Newcastle United owner for paying 20p a share through two intermediaries for the purchase, rather than spend the same amount on the recent open offer aimed at raising &pound;3.6million.It was confirmed last week that he bought 4.26m in shares from Rangers International Football Club plc, more than doubling his stake.Ashley's influence over matters at the club have long concerned the Ibrox faithful.Already worried by the way he has antagonised Newcastle supporters, their fears only increased when it was revealed last month that he had bought naming rights to Ibrox from former chief executive Charles Green for just &pound;1.He has already struck a deal to take over the club's retail division and his latest move appears to be his next bid for increased power at board room level.Reports have recently suggested that club board chairman Sandy Easdale favours Ashley as the man to solve the club's deepening financial troubles, while Wallace would prefer to see former oldco director Dave King return to the club as a new investor.If Ashley's bid to oust Wallace and Nash is to be successful, however, he will have to carry the backing of the majority of the club's stakeholders.Easdale's spokesman Jack Irvine said: &quot;Sandy Easdale is not part of the PLC board and has no knowledge of any of the recent announcements. However he is watching with interest.&quot;
