We're doing an internal investigation that will not be done by me, it'll be (done) by the club to make sure everything's okay.&quot;Asked how much of a disruption the decision would cause him, McNamara said: &quot;It's more a disruption if they're here at the moment.&quot;My focus is Saturday and that's why we decided to do that, to get the rest of the players ready for the game, because to me that's what we're here for, to play games of football.&quot;We'll try to focus the best we can despite all the attention.&quot;The two players are Mark Wilson and Paul Paton. It will take as long as it takes. It's outwith my hands - the club's dealing with it.&quot;Asked directly if the investigation was related to Zaluska, McNamara added: &quot;I don't want to comment on that. We've put a statement out and everything will come out in due course.&quot;United said in a statement on Wednesday: &quot;Dundee United Football Club has commenced an internal investigation into the conduct of two of its players following information received by the club.&quot;Police are investigating the incident involving Zaluska, but have refused to comment on reports that another Scottish Premiership player was involved.Celtic manager Ronny Deila has absolved Polish goalkeeper Zaluska of any blame.
