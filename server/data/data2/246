Write off 'bedroom tax' rent arrears, says MSP COUNCILS should be given the power to write off rent arrears caused by the 'bedroom tax', said Labour's welfare spokeswoman.Jackie Baillie said local authorities needed help to deal with the debts and people in arrears should have the &quot;cloud lifted&quot;.After the First Minister revealed plans to scrap historic poll tax debts by banning councils from pursuing debtors, Ms Baillie asked what help would be available to councils to pay off any bedroom tax arrears from the year before the Scottish Government provided extra cash to top up payments to those affected.Mr Salmond said Finance Secretary John Swinney would address the issue this week in his budget, but did not say how.Ms Baillie has since received an answer to the same question from Margaret Burgess, the housing minister.Ms Baillie had asked whether local authorities have been advised that they can cancel arrears of the so-called 'bedroom tax' arising in 2013-14 and when the Scottish Government will issue guidance on the matter.Ms Burgess said when the cap is lifted councils can top up the payments which will mean no-one will have to pay the shortfall if they claim and are granted a Discre-tionary Housing Payments (DHP). However, she said arrears from the previous year were a matter for landlords.She said: &quot;The manage-ment of arrears, including those related to the bedroom tax, is a matter for landlords as part of their respon-sibility. The cap for DHP will be lifted once the power to do so is transferred to Scottish Ministers.&quot;When that happens, local authorities will be able to top up their DHP accounts to make any further payments in line with local priorities.&quot;Ms Baillie said Mr Swinney must deal with it &quot;decisively&quot; in his budget. She said: &quot;People living under the threat of the collection of bedroom tax arrears need and deserve clarity, which the First Minister failed to give them on Thursday.&quot;When local authorities are facing crippling budget pressures as a result of the council tax freeze, it is incumbent on the Scottish Government to provide assistance to hard-pressed councils so they can deal with these debts.&quot;As John Swinney prepares for his Budget it is incumbent on him to act decisively on this issue.&quot;They must lift the cloud for those struggling to cope with this debt.&quot;stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
