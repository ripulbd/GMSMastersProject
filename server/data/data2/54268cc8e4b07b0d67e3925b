 Chris Chantler is one of several Kilmarnock players nursing minor injuries from the midweek League Cup loss to St Johnstone. 
 Finnish playmaker Alexei Eremenko is available despite his red card in the 1-0 defeat. 
 Partick Thistle pair Ryan Stevenson and Kallum Higginbotham are doubts with ankle knocks. 
 Gary Fraser (knee) is a long-term absentee, although Sean Welsh (groin) has returned to light training. 
  Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston:  &quot;You need to score goals to win games and that's maybe the only thing you could criticise us for (in the midweek cup loss to St Johnstone), that we never took the chances we created. We have to make sure we are clinical when we get in those positions. 
 &quot;But there was a lot of good play and a lot of positives and obviously we were disappointed with the goal that wasn't given. 
 &quot;Partick are a good passing team and have good players like Higginbotham. And they have strengthened by bringing in Stevenson, a centre-half and a left-back as well. They have strengthened their team and I'm sure they will be a big threat. 
 &quot;But we are at home and we have to make sure we win games like this.&quot; 
  Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald:  &quot;Our players will have no excuses. We played on a astro all last year, so they are well used to it. 
 &quot;Kilmarnock will have a wee advantage because they train on the pitch every day but on Saturday, it will be the same for both sides. 
 &quot;There are going to be a lot of games this season that sway on just a couple of mistakes. We need to work as hard as we can to make sure we're taking advantage of others' mistakes rather than the other way around.&quot;
