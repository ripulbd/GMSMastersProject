Anti-poverty campaigners prepare for another George Square food collection THE father and son anti-poverty campaigners who collected thousands of pounds worth of food in George Square are preparing to set up another collection point this weekend.Andrew and Darren Carnegie, originally from Blackhill, Glasgow, are organising another peace rally to collect more food on Saturday.Sales worker Darren, 25, said he was &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the generosity of people from across Scotland who dropped off hundreds of bags of food in the civic centre at the weekend.The collection was in response to the angry scenes which took place in the City Centre on Friday night following the referendum.They are storing food in a building loaned to them by Ruby Murry's takeaway in Tollcross Road. They are urging anyone who needs to help to contact them through social media or by phone.Darren said: &quot;Food banks shouldn't have to exist but while people need them we won't stop helping them.&quot;Some of the things I've seen can only be described as horrific. It makes me sick to my stomach. People are starving across Glasgow and that's just not right.&quot;The family believe they have fed around 1500 people since they set up their food bank, Glasgow's Needy, last year.The Evening Times first reported on the pair's quest to stop poverty at the end of September last year, when they were putting plans in place to help people from their Tollcross home.Darren first made headlines across the world when he appeared in a tartan G string at the G8 Summit at Enniskillen, Northern Ireland in June 2013, carrying a sign which read: Blackhill, Glasgow, end poverty now.&quot;Darren and his dad Andrew are backing the Evening Times' Food for Thought campaign, which is aiming to build a more coordinated approach to food banks and help remove the stigma attached to them, so that no one is any doubt of where or how to find help.If anyone wants to support Glasgow's Needy, they can bring non perishable food such tins, pasta, cereal or baby food as well as unopened toiletries, such as nappies, soap, shampoo, sanitary products, to George Square on Saturday from 12noon.There will also be music, entertainment and speeches.
