The Edinburgh businesswoman is raising funds for counselling for troubled young people and relatives of suicide victims.She is also developing a long-term strategy to work with schools on the subject of suicide and lobbying government to influence public policy.&quot;Josh was like many young men his age - he was struggling to find a job and didn't know where he was going in life,&quot; explains the 38-year-old. &quot;He was losing himself and I was worried for him but I could not find anyone to help.&quot;There is little help in Scotland for young men and that is sad. I set up the Foundation to bridge the gap and make a positive difference. We need to have a national conversation about mental health and tackle this taboo.&quot;SYLVIA DOUGLASSYLVIA Douglas spent her teens in children's units and had a baby when she was 16.Well aware of the trauma of physical abuse, she set up a care group for victims of rape and sexual abuse.MsMissMrs, which runs workshops in Springburn, is helping women rebuild shattered lives.Its successes have already been significant, with many women now able to return to education and work as a result.One young woman has also been able to get her children back from care.&quot;I had abandonment issues, I couldn't form relationships or trust anyone - I know about physical trauma and abuse,&quot; explains the 35-year-old from Springburn.&quot;If these things happen to you when you are young you are left with an overhanging shame.&quot;But there is nothing you can't achieve.&quot;MARIA RIGHETTIWHEN Maria's husband Michael was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease 23 years ago, at the unusually young age of 31, she refused to let it get the better of her.The 53-year-old, who lives in the South Side of Glasgow, set up a charity to raise funds for research into the disease, ran a support group for sufferers and their families, and gave up her job to work from home and care for Michael and their twin daughters.Maria's charity, Michael's Movers, has now raised more than &pound;100,000 and its flagship event - a run round the isle of Cumbrae, starting and finishing in Millport - attracts hundreds of entrants.Despite the challenges of recent years, Maria is unfailingly optimistic.&quot;The girls being so young when Michael was diagnosed - they were just six - that was the hardest part,&quot; recalls Maria.&quot;And he was on a horrendous cocktail of drugs, which brought its own problems. But you just adapt, don't you? You get on with it.&quot;Personal trainer Maria is currently running 500 10ks in 500 days to raise more money for the charity.&quot;Research into this disease is so important - things are advancing all the time,&quot; she explains. &quot;That's why Michael's Movers exists, to fund research and projects that could transform people's lives.&quot;
