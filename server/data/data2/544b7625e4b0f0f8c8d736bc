 Celtic striker John Guidetti returns to Premiership duty having not been registered for the Europa League. 
 Kris Commons will be assessed as he recovers from a buttock injury while James Forrest is still not ready for first-team action. 
 Kilmarnock playmaker Alexei Eremenko has recovered after missing last weekend's win over St Johnstone. 
 Manager Allan Johnston is unsure whether keeper Craig Samson will be fit enough to come back from a broken toe. 
  Celtic manager Ronny Deila on Kilmarnock:  &quot;They've had a good season. They are a little bit like Hamilton, playing with a lot of energy. They have good confidence and they will be hard to break down. 
 &quot;I think we are making good progress and this game is coming at a good moment now. 
 &quot;I hope that we are ahead when we come to Christmas. That's a goal, of course, but we'll see. Every game is difficult and we need to perform well and get the results we want. 
 &quot;I hope that when we come to 1 January we are ahead. The points have to come in.&quot; 
  Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston:  &quot;Alexei's back. He's been training for the last few days so that's a major bonus for the team. Craig Samson is not far away [from being available]. We'll wait until the last minute to see if he's going to be available for the game. 
 &quot;We're going for the win. It doesn't matter who we are playing, home or away, we try to win every game. We'll have to play at our very best to have any chance of winning. 
 &quot;Celtic have good players but I think this year the league is going to be closer than ever. 
 &quot;You're hoping they have an off day, but they have a lot of top quality players and if you give them too much space, good players will hurt you.&quot;
