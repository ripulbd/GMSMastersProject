FIRST new production in 30 years of In Time O' Strife by Joe Corrie is on stage this week at Glasgow's Citizens Theatre. Glasgow theatre show In Time O' Strife reminds Scots of forgotten miner strikes - Daily Record ONE of Scotland’s leading theatre companies reckon a forgotten playwright’s work from 1926 will strike a chord with Scots today.
The National Theatre of Scotland are putting on a production of In Time O’ Strife, written by Joe Corrie, at the Citizens Theatre.
Miner Corrie was involved in the general strike of 1926 and wrote the play to support foodbanks helping the starving families of his friends and colleagues.
NTS director Graham McLaren has adapted the play to reference the 1984 miners’ strikes and current struggles of many Scots.
He said: “People don’t know of Corrie and that’s a crime.
“At the time, he wasn’t really accepted and was considered a bit of an outsider. He felt his background and political beliefs effectively locked him out of the arts establishment.
“This is the first production in almost 30 years of this play – and the first ever by a national company.”
In Time o’ Strife – which will run at the Citizens until Saturday – stars Hannah Donaldson, John Kazek, Tom McGovern, Vicki Manderson, James Robinson, Anita Vettesse and Owen Whitelaw, and includes live music by The Shilling a Week band.
McLaren added there were many similarities between 1926 and what is happening today with social inequality.
He said: “All too quickly these days, we silence people who have something genuine to say.
“This play is nearly 100 years old. It is a cry from the past but might as well be a cry from today.”
