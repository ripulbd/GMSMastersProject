A SENIOR doctor has called for more out-of-hours GP services in hospitals to help drive down A&E waiting times. More GPs in hospital 'would cut wait times for casualty' A SENIOR doctor has called for more out-of-hours GP services in hospitals to help drive down A&E waiting times.Dr Martin McKechnie, the new chairman of the College of Emergency Medicine Scotland, said being able to re-direct patients quickly &quot;through another door&quot; would benefit patients and doctors.A new study at Glasgow's Southern General showed 5-10% of patients who went to A&amp;E did not require emergency treatment.Dr McKechnie, who works in A&amp;E, said the move would give out-of-hours GPs access to diagnostic facilities, reduce duplication of administration and allow patients to be quickly re-triaged if further treatment is required.However, the head of the group that represents GPs said doctors were already struggling to meet patient demand in the community because of &quot;inadequate&quot; numbers of staff.A number of hospitals in Glasgow already have co-located services including the Southern General and the Western Infirmary.Dr McKechnie would like to see this extended to every hospital in Scotland. He also called for the government target that 98% of patients should be seen within four hours to be increased to 100%.Dr McKechnie said: &quot;It is not appropriate for the emergency department to be 'everyone's default'. It is unreasonable to expect patients to determine whether their symptoms reflect serious illness or more minor conditions.&quot;The co-location of out-of-hours GP services on hospital sites enables patients to be streamed following a triage assessment. This also enables collaborative working.&quot;The call comes amid concern about shortages of consultants within A&amp;E departments, with NHS Lanarkshire drawing up plans to downgrade a department in the event it cannot staff all three of its hospitals safely.Dr Alan McDevitt, chairman of the BMA's Scottish GP Committee said: &quot;Strengthen-ing the link between GPs and hospitals could deliver real benefits to patients by ensuring that they get fully joined up care.&quot;However, general practice is suffering from severe workforce pressures.&quot;We already have an inadequate number of GPs that has left GP services struggling to meet patient demand. This is being exacerbated by falls in GP recruitment and the fact that many GPs are considering early retirement. If significant numbers of GPs were to work in A&amp;E rather than in GP surgeries, this could lead to patients not receiving the care they need in the community.&quot;The priority must be to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of GPs to meet the increasing needs of patients who come through the surgery door, especially older patients who need frontline GP care to help them stay at home.&quot;caroline.wilson@eveningtimes.co.uk
