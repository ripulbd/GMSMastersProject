Residents on the Isle of Coll have raised concerns after the island's only free water tap was switched off. Concern on island of Coll as only free water supply is shut down Residents on the Isle of Coll have raised concerns after the island's only free water tap was switched off.
The tap at Coll pier had been used by some households not connected to the mains supply.
Visiting yachts and campervans also used the tap before Argyll and Bute council shut it off following water shortages on the island.
Community council secretary Pat Graham said: &quot;The people who are now without water are very angry.&quot;
Scottish Water asked Argyll and Bute council to put a cap on the tap, which is attached to the outside of a public toilet, following two mains supply water shortages this summer.
The company is looking at how to resolve the situation but says its priority is to ensure paying customers have a reliable supply of water.
Drinking water is available at other points on the island, such as local campsites and community centres, but there is a charge.
Residents have said they are worried about families being left without a free source of drinking water.
There are also fears that touring yachts, an important source of income for the island, may be less likely to stop there.
Peter Ings, a member of the local community council, told BBC Scotland there are a lot of people on the island who are not connected to the mains supply and need access to safe drinking water.
He said: &quot;A fire recently destroyed someone's private water supply and now they have nowhere to go.&quot;
Colleague Pat Graham added: &quot;Although most people are on the mains supply, the people who are now without water are very angry. Especially as there was no warning this was about to happen.&quot;
