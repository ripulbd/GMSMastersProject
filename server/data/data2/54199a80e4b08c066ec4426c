JO Rose, who passed out in front of 1500 fans at city's Old Fruitmarket, tells of recovery on Facebook. Singer at sold-out Glasgow concert collapses on stage - and given first aid at First Aid Kit gig - Daily Record MUSIC fans were left shocked on Tuesday when a singer at sold-out Glasgow concert collapsed on stage - while supporting a band called First Aid Kit.
Manchester singer Jo&nbsp;Rose passed out before an audience of 1500 at the city’s Old Fruitmarket venue in Candleriggs.
The solo act dropped to the ground in front of stunned fans while performing his back-up slot for the Swedish folk-pop group, fronted by sisters Johanna and Klara S&ouml;derberg.
One onlooker in the audience said: “At first I thought it was a bizarre, dramatic finale to his song, but then I realised he wasn’t well. It looked like he was suffering a seizure.
“It’s a really unfortunate irony that something like this happened at a gig by a band of this name. A woman passed out in the toilets too, and a man outside.”
The singer was attended by medics on stage before being helped off. The gig was delayed while he received treatment and a stage hand reassured the audience that the singer was recovering backstage.&nbsp;
Joe later posted a message on his Facebook reassuring his fans.
He said: “Just so you all know, I’m ok after the fall at the Glasgow show. I passed out briefly and everything’s ok now. I can even remember it and it was a lovely show.
&quot;I hope I didn’t give any of you a fright. &nbsp;Thanks for joining me first night of the tour.”
A spokesperson for Glasgow Life, who run the Old Fruitmarket, said: “At First Aid Kit’s concert last night in the Old Fruitmaket support act Jo Rose suffered from a seizure onstage towards the end of his last number.
&quot;First aiders were quick to respond and on their request an ambulance was called and he was taken in for observation.”
