SUPPORTERS from both sides of the campaign gathered in Glasgow city centre last night as the country waited to learn its future.
Groups of Yes and No supporters were in George Square as polling in Scotland's&nbsp;independence referendum&nbsp;closed.
The result of the referendum is expected to go down to the wire, with polls in the last two weeks of the campaign suggesting the result is too close to call.
Voting opened at 7am and ended at 10pm, with the turnout expected to be one of the highest on record.
A total of 4,283,392 people were registered to vote, with 16 and 17-year-olds across the country permitted to take part in the vote for the first time.
 

As soon as Scotland's 2,608 polling places closed, work began to transport hundreds of ballot boxes to counting centres in each of Scotland's 32 local authorities.
Police have reportedly arrested a man after he tried to climb on to the Sir Walter Scott memorial in the centre of the square
