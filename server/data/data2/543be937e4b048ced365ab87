Art school seeks restoration team A renowned art school damaged by fire has launched a search for a design team to lead its restoration.Glasgow School of Art is calling on architect-led, multi-disciplinary design teams from around the globe to register their interest in the Mackintosh building project.The city and the art world were rocked on May 23 when flames engulfed the Grade A-listed building, leading to the loss of about a tenth of the structure and 30% of its contents.Art school bosses want to restore the structure - designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh more than a century ago - to its former glory as a fully functioning art, architecture and design school.Douglas Anderson, estates development project manager, said: &quot;The Mackintosh building is studied in architecture departments across the globe as an example of almost unmatched design with generations of architects inspired by Mackintosh's masterpiece.&quot;The chance to lead the restoration of this truly iconic building is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we are anticipating that there will be significant interest from design teams both in the UK and beyond.&quot;Teams are asked to register an expression of interest by noon on Monday November 10.A shortlist will be drawn up and the teams selected will be invited to submit a full tender. It is anticipated that the design team will be appointed in spring next year.Meanwhile, work on the roof to secure the building against the winter weather has been completed on schedule.A &pound;20 million fundraising campaign is under way to help with repairs to the fire-damaged building, with actors Brad Pitt and Peter Capaldi serving as trustees of the appeal.A spokesman for Scotland For Marriage, the umbrella group which spearheaded opposition to the legislation said there was still a &quot;substantial silent majority&quot; of people who are opposed to same-sex marriage.The spokesman said: &quot;Of course, our Parliament has voted and we accept the outcome of the democratic process.&quot;However, there remains the fact that 80,000 people signed a petition against this legislation. There is a substantial silent majority in this country who take and hold different views from our MSPs.&quot;These people adopt a viewpoint very much opposed to that of the Holyrood metropolitan elite which took the decision to legislate. We hope the views of those opposed to this legislation will continue to be respected in the future.&quot;
