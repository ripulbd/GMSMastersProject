DONATIONS supporting Hope over Fear independence demo in Glasgow are addressed to Sheridan's city home. Shamed politician Tommy Sheridan faces questions over charity cheques sent to his home - Daily Record QUESTIONS have been raised over the funding of an independence rally featuring Tommy Sheridan after it was revealed donations are being sent to his home address.
Thousands are expected to attend the Hope over Fear demo in Glasgow’s George Square today to rally Yes supporters after their defeat in the referendum.
Sheridan yesterday released a line-up of speakers including actors Martin Compston and Paul Brannigan, feminist writer Naomi Wolf and SNP councillors.
The shamed politician, jailed in 2011 after being found guilty of lying under oath about visiting swingers’ clubs, has said hosting the event and paying for the hire of a PA and stage will cost around &pound;3000.

Sheridan appealed for help to pay for the rally, asking for cheques to be made payable to an East Kilbride charity but to be sent to his address in Glasgow.
The charity are called Communities United, Promoting Inclusion, and are run by Solidarity council candidate and Sheridan pal John Park.
A Scottish Labour spokesman said: “There seems an odd arrangement. People will be wondering why a charity has now become a vehicle for Tommy Sheridan and that funding is being sent to his home.”
Park said the request for funding for the rally to be sent to the charity was because Hope over Fear did not have a bank account.
He said: “Any money donated to the rally and paid out will be accounted for. There is proper accounting of the money that is being donated..”
Sheridan was unavailable for comment yesterday.
