 Police appeal 
Officers from Police Scotland are trying to trace a man who may be able to help enquiries into a serious assault in Victoria Road back on May 26 this year.
At around 6.30pm on Monday 26 May 2014, a 31-year-old man was attacked near to the Queen’s Park Railway Station. A member of the public stopped to assist the victim before the suspect then made off in the direction of Queen’s Park.
Police officers are keen to speak to the man in the image as they believe he may be able to assist with their enquiries.
He is described as white, aged late 30s to early 40s, 5ft 7 inches tall, brown hair, medium build, wearing a light coloured jumper, dark trousers or jeans and white trainers.
 

Detective Constable Peter McFarlane, of Cathcart CID, said: &quot;We’ve issued the image of this man, as we believe he may have information which could assist with our enquiries. There seems to be absolutely no reason for the assault – which was severe enough to require stitches.
“The suspect was walking along Victoria Road from the Queens Park end of the road. It was still quite early in the evening and it was a bank holiday so it would have been quite busy at that time of the day with plenty people milling about. We know that a man – a member of the public - stopped to help the injured man and pushed the suspect away before he ran off towards Queens Park. We are keen to speak to this man as he may have information that will help us catch the attacker.&quot;
Anyone with information can contact Cathcart CID via the Police Scotland non emergency number on 101 or alternatively, in confidence to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

 Hallo-green 
Glaswegians are being urged to cook their pumpkins after Halloween to help reduce waste sent to landfills.
Zero Waste Scotland urged residents to get creative in what they do with the 100,000 pumpkins being bought this year. More than 380,000 tonnes of food is thrown away every year. That’s enough to save &pound;470 a year for a Glasgow family, said a spokesman.
So while pumpkin carving is tempting, they don’t just have to be tossed in the bin after.
Here are two recipes courtesy Zero Waste Scotland for a post-Halloween pumpkin treat.
&nbsp;
All of these recipes are available on lovefoodhatewaste.com.

Roast Pumpkin Lasagne
This comforting meal is surprisingly simple, and very seasonal. Swap the pumpkin for squash if that's what you have to hand.
&nbsp;
INGREDIENTS:
75ml olive oil
500g pumpkin flesh, diced
Pinch of cayenne
Pinch of Spanish smoked paprika
Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
Salt
black pepper
Fresh rosemary
225g ricotta chese
50g butter
50g flour
350ml milk
250g fresh raw lasagne
35g freshly grated Parmesan cheese
&nbsp;
METHOD:
• Heat the olive oil in a roasting dish, add the pumpkin flesh and season with the cayenne, paprika, nutmeg and a little salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the fresh rosemary, place into a pre heated oven set at gas mark 6/200C/400F and cook for an hour until the flesh is tender.
• Add the ricotta cheese and mix through, remove from the heat and leave to infuse.
• Make a white sauce by melting the butter, adding the flour and mixing together. Cook gently over a low heat and slowly add the milk, stirring to ensure that the sauce is smooth. Season.
• Cover the base of an ovenproof dish with a little of the sauce, add a layer of the lasagne and top with the pumpkin mixture. Repeat with another layer of each and top with the parmesan cheese.
• Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes until the top is golden brown.

Roasted Pumpkin and Coriander Soup
&nbsp;
INGREDIENTS:
1 small pumpkin
2 red peppers
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed
&frac12; teaspoon juniper seeds
100g celery, chopped
2 small red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
1 litre vegetable or chicken stock
Large bunch of fresh coriander, chopped
Salt
Black pepper
2 tablespoons of cr&egrave;me fraiche
Pinch of Spanish smoked paprika
&nbsp;
METHOD:
• Quarter the pumpkin, remove the seeds (don’t discard them, they are lovely when roasted and make a great nibble - see our great recipe).
• Cut the red peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them with the pumpkin onto a roasting tray. Drizzle the flesh with a little olive oil and place into a pre heated oven set at gas mark 6/200C/400F and roast for about 40 minutes.
• Remove from the oven. Scrape the flesh from the skin of the pumpkin and place to one side along with the roasted pepper.
• Heat a little olive oil in a saucepan; add the chopped onion, crushed garlic, juniper seeds, celery and red chillies. Cook for a few minutes until the onions and celery are soft.
• Add the pumpkin and red peppers, the stock and finally the chopped coriander. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and then process the soup in a blender to make it smooth.
• Serve with a spoonful of cr&egrave;me fraiche over the top sprinkled with a little paprika.
