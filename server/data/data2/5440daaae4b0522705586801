TWO students have been diagnosed with meningitis at a Glasgow university, prompting fears over a spread of the killer bug. Warning as city uni students hit with killer bug TWO students have been diagnosed with meningitis at a Glasgow university, prompting fears over a spread of the killer bug.Within the last week two separate cases of bacterial meningitis were diagnosed at Strathclyde University.Last night the university e-mailed all their students warning about the potentially fatal &shy;infection, along with an advisory letter from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.The NHS letter confirmed the two cases, and stated: &quot;The Public Health Protection Unit, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, has been notified of two cases of meningococcal infection in Strathclyde students within the last week.&quot;The first case is a student studying Education and Psychology, and the second is studying Computer Science and Law.&quot;We have not identified a link between the two cases.&quot;Students were given advice about how to spot the symptoms of the brain-swelling &shy;disease and were told that only people in close contact with those infected were at risk.It is understood people close to the two infected students have already been informed and given medical advice.Speaking to the Evening Times, a mature student &shy;studying at the institution said: &quot;It's very worrying to think two unconnected &shy;students have got this.&quot;I know it's very serious and term has just started so there are lots of students about - I hope they are both okay.&quot;I was shocked when I read the e-mail, I wasn't expecting that.&quot;I hadn't heard anything about it before.&quot;I know lots of bugs go around halls when students start - freshers flu - but I hadn't heard anything about this.&quot;Shortly after thousands of students received the e-mail, many took to Twitter to share their thoughts, speculating about whether they could be next to catch it.A spokeswoman from Strathclyde University said: &quot;The two cases are not connected, but as a precaution, we are circulating information to staff and students to remind them of the signs and symptoms to be aware of.&quot;hannah.rodger@ eveningtimes.co.uk
