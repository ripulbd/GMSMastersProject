The first John Hartson Foundation Ball, held in the city’s Thistle Hotel, marked five years since the 39-year-old’s life-threatening battle with testicular cancer.
Scots screen stars Gary Hollywood – who plays Dino in smash hit comedy Mrs Brown’s Boys – and BAFTA award-winning Morvern Callar actress Kathleen McDermott compered the sell-out gala.
Line of Duty star Martin Compston and Los Angeles-based Scots actor and producer Gianni Capaldi, whose films include action-packed dramas Hard Rush and Blood of Redemption, were among the celebrities attending.
Hartson said: “This means so much to me to see so many people turning out to support my foundation.
Just over five years ago I had my own cancer battle and I feel very blessed that I got through it.
“Many people don’t, and I feel privileged that thanks to the amazing work of the doctors and nurses who saved me, I was able to get through it and enjoy seeing my five children grow up.”
