THE No campaign was on the brink of victory this morning as they scored a number of major victories over Yes Scotland in key areas across Scotland. Independence referendum: Yes Scotland take Glasgow but on brink of defeat as No campaign take stranglehold - Daily Record THE No campaign was on the brink of victory early today as Yes Scotland failed to make inroads in key council areas.
Yes narrowly won both Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, but not by the numbers needed to challenge the No camp’s early lead.
And South Lanarkshire delivered a solid No vote.
Glasgow was Yes by 194,779 to 169,347, while North Lanarkshire was Yes by 115, 783 to 110, 922.
South Lanarkshire voted No by 121,800 top 100,990.
By 4.55 am the total was No 1,200,819 to Yes 1,027, 810 or 53.9 per cent to 46.1 per cent in favour of No.
Poor early results had left Yes Scotland praying for huge votes in the big west of Scotland councils - votes which did not come in big enough numbers.
Falkirk delivered a huge blow to Yes when it voted solidly No.
The No votes piled up in Perth and Kinross where the result was 62,714 for No against 41, 475 for Yes.
West Lothian was also a bad result for Yes Scotland with Better Together winning by 65, 684 to 53, 342.
This followed a triple-whammy of bad declarations for Yes in Midlothian, East Lothian and Stirling.
They were swiftly followed by No votes in Dumfries, Aberdeen city, Angus, East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire.
Aberdeen and Dumfries delivered huge amounts of votes for NO.
But Faklkirk was the biggest set-back for Yes where 58,030 voted NO, against 50,489 for Yes in Yes Scotland chairman Dennis Canavan’s heartland.
In Midlothian 33, 720 voted No against 26,370 for Yes.
In East Lothian it was a more emphatic 44,283 for No against 27,467 for Yes, while Stirling was 37,153 for No against 25,010 for Yes.
In Angus it was No by 45,192 to 35, 044.
Aberdeen delivered a huge No vote of 84,094 to 59, 390, while Dumfries and Galloway was 70,039 to 36,614.
East Renfrewshire was No by 41,690 to 24,287, while East Dunbartonshire was No by 48,214, to 30,624.
West Dunbartonshire was Yes by 33,720 to 28,776, while Dundee gave Yes Scotland a glimmer of cheer as the city delivered a resounding yes.
It was the first local authority to return a Yes vote at 3.53am.
The vote was 53,620 for Yes, while No polled 39,880.
But Renfrewshire, containing the big urban centre of Paisley - votes needed by Yes - delivered a boon for No as 62.067 voted for Better Together, while 55,466 voted Yes.
Yes had suffered two early major blows as Eilean Siar and Inverclyde both delivered No votes - by the narrowest of margins.
The Yes campaign had high hopes for the Western Isles and Inverclyde - a key urban barometer of how well the Yes campaign had marshalled first-time voters.
But in a turnout of 87 per cent the vote went 27,329 for No against 27, 243 for Yes.
And while the national poll is all about overall votes rather than council areas, by 3.40am, Yes Scotland was still waiting on its first “win”.
Inverclyde was reckoned to be thye Yes campaign’s fourth strongest council area.
Yes were left praying for huge numbers of votes in Glasgow.
After polling stations closed at 10pm last night, First Minister Alex Salmond said: “This has been a remarkable day. Scotland’s future truly is in Scotland’s hands.”
But the Scottish National Party leader did not attend his local count in Aberdeenshire, as he had been expected to.
SNP MP Stewart Hosie insisted nothing should be read into Mr Salmond’s absence, telling Sky News that this “might be the action of a First Minister who has to attend the national declaration in Edinburgh”.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she was quietly confident that the “silent majority” of Scots would give a victory to No.
Ms Davidson said whatever the result, politics in Scotland would not be the same: “The status quo has been thoroughly smashed. Whether it is a Yes vote or a No vote, Scotland is going to change after this.”
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, one of the most senior Liberal Democrat ministers in the coalition Government, said:”It does look like we have secured a No vote and that is clearly very welcome.
“It is also important to say a No vote is a mandate for change in Scotland, it’s a mandate for the strong proposals on more powers for the Scottish Parliament we have been setting out in this campaign.”
It was bad news for Yes also in the Eilean Siar - Western Isles - which Yes had high hopes of winning.
But at 3am the vote there was declared as 10,544 No to 9,195 for Yes.
Shetland also delivered a blow for Yes Scotland with a No vote of 9,951, to a Yes vote of 5,699 when the result was announced at 2.41 am.
Orkney confounded the opinion polls and delivered a solid No vote early today.
The result, at 2am, was 10,004 NO votes, with 4,883 for YES.
That represents a 67.2 per cent vote for NO, at a time when national polls were showing 54 per cent for NO.
The result was another early blow for the Yes campaign after Scotland’s smallest council area declared the first result of the referendum at 1.28am.
Clackmannanshire delivered a No vote, polling 19,036 votes and Yes claiming 16,350.
There were 24 spolit ballot papers on a turnout of 88.6 per cent.
The area had been a key target for Yes campaigners, with Scottish Government minister Keith Brown representing the area at Holyrood.
Commenting on the result, Conservative MSP Gavin Brown said: “The bookies odds said that Dundee was favourite to get the highest percentage for Yes, and I think Clackmannanshire were second favourite to get the highest so I certainly thought Clackmannanshire would have a majority for Yes.
“So for it to have a majority for No is clearly welcome from our side. It’s the first result, there’s a long way to go and clearly in terms of actual voting numbers it smaller than most local authorities, but it’s a welcome start to the evening.”
Meanwhile, voting turnout is expected to shatter polling day records as other council areas revealed the number of people that had cast their vote.
In West Lothian, the turnout was 86.2 per cent - 119,115 votes out of a total electorate of 138,212.
In Shetland the turnout was 84.4 per cent, in Angus turnout was 85.7 per cent, while in Midlothian it was 86.8 per cent.
There were similar high turnouts in East Ayrshire, at 84.5 per cent .In South Ayrshire, it was 86.1 per cent and in Stirling it was 90.1 per cent.
