Glasgow restaurants named in prestigious Michelin Guide Restaurants ranging from country pubs to "hipster hangouts" are among the 14 new stars announced in the latest Michelin Guide.The prestigious guide, widely considered to be the pinnacle of restaurant ratings, has awarded new stars across the UK - including two in Wales, two on the Scottish islands and one in Cornwall.They include Isle of Eriska in Eriska and Three Chimneys and The House Over-By on the Isle of Skye, Ynyshir Hall in Machynlleth, and the Crown at Whitebrook in Monmouth.Cornwall's latest star has gone to Port Isaac's Nathan Outlaw and his Outlaw's Fish Kitchen.The Treby Arms, owned by MasterChef 2012 winner Anton Piotrowski, is one of three new pubs to gain a star.The guide said the diversity was even more pronounced in London, referring to two restaurants with counters awarded stars - Spanish tapas bar Barrafina and Kitchen Table at Bubbledogs, which serves a no-choice set menu.Other London winners are Indian restaurant Gymkhana, The Clove Club and Fera at Claridge's, headed by Simon Rogan, while Jason Atherton has achieved another star at City Social.The guide's editor, Rebecca Burr, said: &quot;The 14 new stars in our 2015 guide highlight the enormous richness and variety of the UK's restaurant scene. They range from country pubs to hipster hangouts, from counter restaurants to classic dining rooms.&quot;The public's knowledge and interest in food gets greater every year and it won't just be fans of cookery shows who will be planning trips to Devon to the Treby Arms.&quot;The Clove Club shows that there is no shortage of talented young chefs coming through. Barrafina has just got better and better over the years and even when a second branch was being planned and subsequently opened, we still experienced the same high standard of cooking.&quot;This year's selection also sees 26 new Bib Gourmands, nine of which are in London, which recognise restaurants offering good food at affordable prices, the limit being &pound;28 for three courses.They include Iberico World Tapas in Derby, 64 in Brighton, and Palomar in Soho, as well as The Gannet and Ox and Finch, both in Glasgow.Ms Burr said: &quot;The Bib Gourmand awards also reflect the continuing trend for competitively-priced, less structured and more flexible dining.&quot;
