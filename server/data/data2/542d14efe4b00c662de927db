Dog walker 'found underwear' A DOG walker told a court he found a gun, a mobile phone and two bin bags full of women's underwear at a disused quarry.James McIlduff, 30, said that he also discovered a piece of cardboard with duct tape on it and a large jacket.He was giving evidence at the trial of Thomas Feeney, 47, who denies robbing and sexually assaulting, with intent to rape, a 33-year-old woman at a property near Shotts, North Lanarkshire, on September 5 last year.It is alleged that Feeney tied the woman up with duct tape and robbed her of &pound;2000, car keys, a BMW 3 series car and underwear.Feeney also denies a firearms offence by using an imitation gun with intent to cause the woman to believe unlawful violence would be used against her.Mr McIlduff told the High Court in Glasgow that he was walking at the quarry sometime after Christmas time last year when he saw the items.He said: &quot;I saw stuff scattered around.&quot;It didn't look as if it had been there long.&quot;There were two bags of underwear - a lot of it still had tags on.&quot;I thought someone had stolen them from a shop.&quot;The court heard that Mr McIlduff did not report this find to the police.But weeks later while working in Shetland, he saw a reconstruction of the incident on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and told a friend of the 33-year-old woman what he had seen at the disused quarry on a back road near Clarkston.The trial before Judge Norman Ritchie QC continues.
