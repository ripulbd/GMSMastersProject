Miss Hoolie joins bid to save West End nursery row TELEVISION nursery teacher Miss Hoolie has stepped in to support a real closure-threatened school.Julie Wilson Nimmo, who played the Balamory character, is backing calls from parents to save Kelvin Park Early Years Centre (EYC). As previously told in the Evening Times, Glasgow City Council has proposed closing the centre to make room for the adjacent Hillhead Primary.Parents are furious at the suggestion, saying it is a drastic solution to a short-term problem.Julie, who lives near to the Hillhead school and visits regularly, said Kelvin Park is a vital resource.She added: &quot;I love that whole development. I live in the community and love the team of people who work there. Having spent time with the kids and parents there, it's a passion of mine.&quot;I can't believe it would be shut down - it's ludicrous. It's the only nursery in the area that is open until 6pm, making it vital for parents, especially single parents, who want to go out to work.&quot;I can't bear the thought of it being closed. I would urge everyone who has an opinion - for or against - to make sure they get involved by going to the online consultation and leaving their views.&quot;Kelvin Park is the only council-funded EYC in the West End of the city to offer full-time child care 52 weeks a year. Closing it would mean moving 120 children.To deal with overcrowding at Hillhead, education chiefs have issued a consultation document that proposes changes to the catchment area. It also proposes closing and moving the children and staff of Kelvin Park to six different nurseries to make space for two classrooms and a general purpose room. Children would be moved to Cowcaddens Nursery, Woodside Nursery, Cranstonhill Nursery, Oakgrove Primary, which does not currently have a nursery but does have a spare classroom, and Elie Street Nursery.Only two of these offer 52-week opening hours.A council spokeswoman said: &quot;We welcome the thoughts of all interested parties so that an informed decision on the proposals can be made.&quot;catriona.stewart@eveningtimes.co.uk
