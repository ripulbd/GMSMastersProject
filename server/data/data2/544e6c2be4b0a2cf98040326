Anas Sarwar has ruled himself out of the running to replace Johann Lamont as Scottish Labour leader. Sarwar to rule out leadership bid Anas Sarwar has ruled himself out of the running to replace Johann Lamont as Scottish Labour leader.Mr Sarwar said he wants to focus on keeping &quot;the Scottish Labour family together&quot;, and will work to ensure the new leader deepens the involvement of party members, trade unionists and the wider movement in their policy development process.The Glasgow Central MP, who is deputy Scottish leader, was appointed interim Scottish leader following Ms Lamont's resignation on Friday.Ms Lamont, who has been MSP for Glasgow Pollok since the Scottish Parliament inception in 1999, launched a parting attack on senior colleagues at Westminster who she accused of treating Scotland as a &quot;branch office&quot;.Mr Sarwar said: &quot;I can confirm that I am not seeking nomination to be leader of the Scottish Labour Party.&quot;There is a crucial job to be done in this interim period. For the last three years it has been my priority to keep the UK family together; in this coming period I am clear that we will keep the Scottish Labour family together.&quot;My focus as interim leader has to be on coming through this process with a Scottish Labour Party unified in purpose, stronger in will, speaking out and standing up for the individuals, families and communities who need a Labour Party in government, delivering on their priorities.&quot;Of course, there will be a focus on ensuring the process to elect a new leader is done in a smooth but robust manner.&quot;But, I also have three priorities over this period: to ensure that we deliver on the pledge to strengthen the Scottish Parliament through the Smith Commission; to continue to hold both Governments to account who, I believe, are failing the people of Scotland as we see inequality on the rise, child poverty increasing, our NHS in crisis and college places being decimated; build towards the general election so we can help return a Labour government and a Labour prime minister so we can get the real change our nation needs.&quot;It is not my intention to publicly declare support for any candidate. That would be wrong in my role as interim leader.&quot;Rather, I will be fulfilling my responsibility to the members who elected me, asking the same questions of candidates as I am sure they will be.&quot;Firstly, how as leader do they intend to deepen the involvement of party members, trade unionists and the wider movement in their policy development process?&quot;Secondly, how they intend to use the collective talents of our MSPs, MPs, MEPs and councillors to continue to hold the SNP and Tories to account.&quot;And, thirdly, how they intend to use the powers the Scottish Parliament has, and the new powers it is guaranteed, to tackle the rising levels of poverty and inequality being visited on the Scottish people by the Tory and SNP Governments.&quot;Candidates for the post of leader of the Scottish Labour Party have been invited to declare their interest from today.The party will announce its new leader on December 13.Scottish Labour's Executive Committee met yesterday and agreed a timetable for the election process.Nominations from MPs, MSPs and MEPs will open on Friday October 31 and close on Tuesday November 4.The ballot starts on Monday November 17 and the new leader will be announced on Saturday December 13.Among those tipped for the leadership are MP Jim Murphy and several prominent MSPs including Kezia Dugdale, Jenny Marra and Neil Findlay.Gordon Brown has also been linked to the role but reports have suggested the former prime minister has ruled himself out of the running.Scottish Labour welfare spokeswoman Jackie Baillie confirmed today she has no intention to stand, insisting she &quot;would much rather play a supporting role than be the leader itself&quot;.She told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: &quot;I think that's a healthy dose of reality on my part.&quot;Ms Baillie, who pre-empted UK Labour leader Ed Miliband's official announcement that the party would scrap the so-called bedroom tax, denied she had been &quot;gagged&quot; by the UK party.She was repeatedly left out on a limb when her assurances that Labour would scrap the under-occupancy charge were denied by the UK party until Mr Miliband's official announcement at the autumn conference last year.But Ms Baillie said it was &quot;offensive&quot; to suggest she had been gagged in the run-up to the conference.&quot;I brought forward a Member's Bill to try and stop evictions as a consequence of the bedroom tax,&quot; she said.&quot;Myself and (fellow Labour MSP) Iain Gray brought forward proposals at the Budget to mitigate the bedroom tax, at no stage was I gagged and told 'You can't campaign on this'; in fact, we've done the reverse and I'm delighted, if you want to talk about a Scottish solution, that's what we delivered.&quot;
