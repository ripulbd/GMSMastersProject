FOUR armed thugs have staged a daring daylight robbery on at least two jewellers’ shops.
The balaclava wearing robbers used sledgehammers and an axe to steal items from Glasgow’s Argyll Arcade.
They were caught on camera running from the shopping area behind a cloud of smoke which had been set off by the shop's own security system and carrying hammers.
It is believed Rox and Laings of Glasgow were the stores affected.
Police said they have launched an investigation into the raid which took place at around 11.50am.
