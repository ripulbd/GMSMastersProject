MICHELLE Estall, 29, was listening to Knoxy on Bowie at Breakfast in her car as usual when she heard Stephen Summers, 27, asking her to marry him. Boyfriend proposes live on DJ Knoxy's morning show on Radio Clyde - Daily Record CLYDE 1 turned into Bride 1 yesterday when a breakfast show fan’s boyfriend popped the question between the pop tunes – and she said yes.
And DJ Knoxy has agreed to play the love songs at Michelle Estall’s wedding to romantic Stephen Summers.
Michelle, 29, was listening to Knoxy on Bowie at Breakfast in her car as usual when she heard Stephen, 27, asking her to marry him.
He’d rung the station to ask if he could propose on air. And after Michelle heard his message of love, she phoned in to say yes.
Michelle said: “It was a huge shock. I didn’t expect to be on the radio, let alone be proposed to.
“It was just a normal day but then I heard Stephen’s voice and he was asking to marry me.”
Michelle, a cake shop owner from Cardonald in Glasgow, will marry Stephen in 2016.
She said: “I’m really over the moon. My phone’s been going crazy all day with friends and family who heard it.”
 

Stephen, a lifeguard from Barrhead, near Glasgow, said: “I was a bit nervous before I called in but I never really had any doubts she would say yes.
“I recorded my proposal and they played it just before 9am, when I knew Michelle would hear it. She’s a big fan of the morning show.
“She then called the station and I spoke to her on the air. It went like a dream – now we just have to pick a venue for the wedding.”
Knoxy said: “I’m a sucker for romance, so I was delighted Clyde 1 was going to be part of Stephen and Michelle’s special story.
“Everyone at the station waited for Michelle to call us back and there was a resounding cheer from the entire team when we heard her say yes.
“We’re looking forward to hearing all about the wedding plans and I can’t wait to be their DJ.”
