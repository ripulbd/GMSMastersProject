Robber jailed for stealing legs of lamb and threatening to stab staff in Farmfoods An armed robber who escaped with two legs of lamb from a store after threatening to stab staff has been jailed for three years.A supervisor became suspicious of Kenneth Wilson as he browsed the aisles at a branch of Farmfoods in Glasgow's Maryhill area.Myasar Al-Muqhafar watched as Wilson, 49, put a basket he was carrying into a freezer and placed the cuts of meat in carrier bags he had brought with him.The supervisor alerted a work colleague, Scott Bradley, to his suspicions and both went to confront Wilson.Wilson was asked to remove the meat from the bags and leave the store in Shiskine Drive.He pulled out a large kitchen knife with a blade up to six inches long.He pointed the weapon at the employees and walked towards then and aggressively said: &quot;I'm going to stab you.&quot;Wilson fled from the shop still carrying the knife in one hand and the bags with his haul of meat in the other.Police officers viewed still images taken from CCTV of the robbery and identified Wilson as the perpetrator.Officers went to his home in Wyndford Road, Glasgow, and detained him as he left a lift.Wilson was interviewed and denied any involvement. He said: &quot;I'm totally innocent of this charge and I will prove it in court.&quot;But he later admitted he assaulted Mr Al-Muqhafar and Mr Bradley by brandishing a knife at them and robbing them of two legs of lamb on June 22 this year, when he appeared in court.He committed the offence after he was granted bail earlier that month at Glasgow Justice of the Peace Court.Defence counsel Susan Duff told the High Court in Edinburgh that Wilson was in &quot;no doubt&quot; that a jail sentence would be imposed on him but asked a judge to restrict it as much as he was able to.She said: &quot;While the offence undoubtedly was very upsetting for the shop staff involved and was aggravated by the knife his intention was shoplifting.&quot;She said Wilson, who has spent &quot;significant periods in custody&quot;, had returned to using drugs.The court heard that Wilson has an extensive criminal record which included a previous 10 year prison sentence for assault and robbery.Lord Boyd of Duncansby told Wilson that he accepted that his initial intention was to steal from the shop but said he had then produced a large knife when confronted by the staff.The judge told Wilson that he had &quot;an appalling record&quot; and said he would have jailed him for four and a half years but for his guilty plea.Lord Boyd said: &quot;I accept you are expressing a willingness to turn your life around.&quot;He ordered that Wilson be kept under supervision for a further year.
