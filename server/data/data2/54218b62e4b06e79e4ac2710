Katherine Grainger announces comeback in bid to qualify for Rio 2016 Scots rower Katherine Grainger has announced she is to make a comeback in a bid to qualify for the Rio 2016 Olympics.Grainger, a four time Olympic medallist who won gold at London 2012 in the double sculls, made the announcement on her Facebook page today.The Glasgow-born rower has been reluctant to make a decision on her future since her gold medal win, neither competing nor announcing her retirement.In a statement she said: &quot;It's now over two years since the London Olympics and it's really about time that decisions were made. For my own sanity as much as anything else. I've discussed, listened, thought, considered. And still felt none the wiser. So it's time to return to the boat and test the waters (literally). I've missed it, I love it, I want to see if I can be good at it again. No guarantees, no promises, but a start. Many people have said it's a risk, but in the words of Neil Simon the playwright 'If no one ever took risks, Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor'.&quot;
