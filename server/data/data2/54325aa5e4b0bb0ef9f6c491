Station gears up for bike fans TRAIN commuters will be able to get on their bikes thanks to a new cycle repair shop.The service will be available at a pop up workshop at Glasgow's Central Station.The new service is being trialled by Grease Monkey Cycles and, if successful, the workshop could become a fortnightly event on the station concourse.The 'Bike Love' workshop will literally pop up at the station on Wednesday and is expected to remain open for three hours after its launch at 4pm.Grease Monkey Cycles is based in Edinburgh and operates a similar repair and maintenance workshop at the capital's Waverley Station every two weeks.Managing director David Wray said: &quot;Travelling by train with a bike is not easy and Glasgow Central Station recognises this. The launch is about doing something practical to help commuters put their bike at the heart of their journey.&quot;Grease Monkey pop up workshops encourage cyclists to go by bike, even when travelling by train, and not just arrive at the station by car or taxi. This is better for health, eases traffic and help free up parking spaces in the city centre.&quot;&quot;We want to trial it at Central Station and, if it proves popular we'd like to introduce fortnightly worskshops to help keep city cyclist on the move from train to work.&quot;
