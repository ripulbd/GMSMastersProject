First Scots same-sex marriage ceremonies to take place on Hogmanay Scotland will stage its first same-sex weddings this year as Health Secretary Alex Neil announced gay couples can tie the knot in marriage ceremonies from December 31.Mr Neill said the move was an &quot;important signal that our nation is absolutely committed to the same rights for all our citizens&quot;.He added that Hogmanay would be &quot;a proud and no doubt emotional day for many&quot; and said: &quot;I, for one, can't wait.&quot;The announcement of the date for the first same-sex weddings in Scotland comes after Holyrood passed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Act earlier this year.As well as allowing for same-sex couples to wed from December 31 onwards, those couples who are already in a civil partnership will be able to convert that to a marriage from December 16 onwards.This can take place from an earlier date as a minimum notice period of 14 clear days is required for marriage ceremonies.Couples who convert their civil partnership to a marriage in the first year of the legislation will not be charged to do so, the Scottish Government pledged.Mr Neil said: &quot;It is wonderful that same-sex couples can now begin to make plans to have their marriage just as any other couple can.&quot;This historic legislation had overwhelming support across the Scottish Parliament, demonstrating to the world how importantly Scotland views equality.&quot;That support means that, from 31 December, same-sex couples who want to show their love and commitment to each other could get married in front of family and friends at a ceremony they choose together.&quot;The announcement was welcomed by equality campaigners, who have lobbied for same-sex couples to be allowed to get married.Tom French, policy and public affairs coordinator for the Equality Network, said: &quot;We are very pleased that after years of campaigning for equal marriage it is now just weeks away from becoming a reality.&quot;Today's milestone announcement means that same-sex couples across Scotland will be able to set a date and start planning their weddings. With the first ceremonies set to take place on Hogmanay, Scotland can be proud that we will bring in the new year as a fairer and more equal country.&quot;He said December 31 2014 would be &quot;a date that is remembered for many years to come, and a profoundly emotional day for those couples who celebrate their commitment to each other&quot;.He also stressed the importance of the legislation for all Scottish lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people who &quot;grew up in a country where being gay was still criminalised until 1981&quot;.Mr French said: &quot;Scotland is now a leader on LGBTI equality, with one of the most progressive equal marriage laws in the world. There is still more to do to ensure full equality in people's day-to-day lives, but this year we have taken a huge leap forward towards creating the fair and equal Scotland we all want to see.&quot;
