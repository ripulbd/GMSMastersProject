Fugitive has network of help DETECTIVES are trying to unravel a network of accomplices suspected of harbour-ing a dangerous fugitive.Senior officers believe Jonathan Kelly, 34, has been supported by friends who have helped him remain a step ahead of police.As the search for the wanted man continues, a team of around 10 officers are working to establish new lines of inquiry.Glasgow remains at the centre of the huge manhunt for Kelly, who was recently freed from Low Moss Prison, Bishopbriggs, and has failed to report to police.Senior sources close to the investigation said anyone &quot;harbouring or helping&quot; the violent convict would be prosecuted.It comes after armed cops - acting on intelligence - swooped on a Glasgow street.But following a seven-hour operation, Kelly was nowhere to be found.Armed response teams and the dog unit were called to a flat in Boyd Street, Govanhill, at around 11.20am on Monday after reports Kelly had been spotted.Families were stopped from returning to their homes after a cordon was thrown around the street.It is understood Kelly has &quot;associates&quot; across the Glasgow area - many of whom he may have met during his time in prison.He has previously told of attacking people, and even paralysing a man in a machete attack. While still in prison, Kelly wrote to campaign group Miscarriages of Justice UK about his life of violence.Detective Inspector Ian Hylands said: &quot;I would appeal to Kelly to give himself up and contact police with a view to handing himself in.&quot;rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk
