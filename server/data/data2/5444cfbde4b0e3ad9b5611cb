GRIEVING relatives are often the first to broach the subject of organ donation in countries with opt-out transplant systems, a study shows. Let's take fear out of organ donations GRIEVING relatives are often the first to broach the subject of organ donation in countries with opt-out transplant systems, a study shows.The research into organ donation procedures in hospitals in Belgium and Norway found &quot;it was not unusual&quot; for relatives to broach the subject.Barbara Neads, who helped shape UK transplant policy and carried out the study, says the UK &quot;has a long way to go&quot; before it is on a par with other European countries in terms of public awareness and acceptance of organ donation and staff training.Ms Neads, 56, who worked in intensive care and A&amp;E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Southern General Hospital, said many staff in the UK do not feel sufficiently trained to broach the subject of organ donation with families. She described the potential loss of transplants as &quot;a travesty&quot;.She said even the very process of changing the transplant laws in countries such as Belgium had had a positive impact on education and awareness.Ms Neads, who now lectures in nursing at Napier University, Edinburgh, said: &quot;Many staff do not feel confident enough about approaching families, they do not feel trained enough.&quot;They may make a decision if the families are very distressed, if the death was particularly traumatic, they might feel it would be detrimental, we can't go there.&quot;They know those organs are lost and they accept that because they do not feel confident. I think it is a travesty that staff are not trained in bereavement counselling and organ donation.&quot;We are not doing anything like what they are doing in Europe, where there are specialised courses for people in intensive care and theatre.&quot;It starts from day one of their training.&quot;They feel more confident about approaching families.&quot;I asked a lot of doctors, 'How is it broached?' They will say to families, 'Are you aware your relative did not object to organ donation?'&quot;Sometimes, in Belgium and Norway, they are asked by relatives first, because it is so normal. I think there is more of a sense of com&shy;munity, it is abnormal not to donate. But it has taken 5-10 years to achieve that.&quot;She said more needed to be done to take the &quot;fear and suspicion&quot; out of organ donation.&quot;It is about answering all the family's questions, convincing them everything possible that could be done has been done to save their loved one, taking families in to see their relative,&quot; she said.&quot;Of those countries I studied, there was no requirement for the doctors to ask permission for donation to go ahead, but they always did.&quot;A consultation on a possible Bill to introduce an opt-out system in Scotland will end on Thursday.If you wish to take part in the consultation see the website: www.anne mctaggart.co.uk/organ-donation-bill-consultation-launchedcaroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
