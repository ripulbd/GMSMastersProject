A YOUTH crime explosion could be sparked if a cash-strapped community centre is forced to close. Fears youth club's closure may spark teen crimewave A YOUTH crime explosion could be sparked if a cash-strapped community centre is forced to close.South Side residents are battling to save the Arden Chillout Centre, which will shut its doors before Christmas if it cannot secure cash.A former Evening Times Community Champion winner, the centre offers a lifeline for many youngsters in the area, but only survives thanks to the work of around 12 volunteers and two paid members of staff.It opened nine years ago, with the help of TV design duo Colin and Justin, and is now the last remaining youth club in the area.The centre, on Kilmuir Road, gives 80 children as young as four a place to do their homework, and learn and play with friends in a safe environment.It also gives them access to musical instruments, books, computers, games consoles and the internet - luxuries many do not have at home.Staff at the centre fear if it closes down, there will be a surge in anti-social behaviour as children and teenagers will have nowhere to go.Kimberley Baker, the centre's project manager, said: &quot;Kids would be playing in the street and quite possibly getting into a bit of bother.&quot;There are a few kids in the area who cause problems, but, actually, in the last while they have been showing an interest in the club and they've been in a few times.&quot;These kids caused some massive damage before, so to see them come in here and get excited because we have a pool table, it's great.&quot;There is good in them, but they're just bored.&quot;They need somewhere safe to go, and it keeps them off the streets and away from all that trouble.&quot;It also teaches them about rules and how to behave.&quot;Having previously relied on grants, the dwindling volunteer numbers at the centre have made it difficult for the remaining staff to find time to apply for funding.Despite having applied for around 20 grants this year, they haven't managed to secure any cash to keep the place going, never mind carry out much-needed repairs.Pollok councillor David MacDonald has stepped in to help the centre, and is organising a variety of charity events in a bid to raise cash,Mr MacDonald said: &quot;They have done so much good work and they are now facing such a difficult situation.&quot;I'm hoping there are people out there who can help.&quot;I'm going to be doing some local fund raising, which will hopefully buy them a bit of time to keep the building open.&quot;We are going to do a gig and comedy event, and a sponsored but there are other ideas we're thinking of too.&quot;This is the last youth club in the Greater Pollok ward.&quot;We've lost far too much in terms of youth services, so to lose another one would mean there were no facilities for young people.&quot;Otherwise, people can end up isolated, on the street or just sitting at home.&quot;hannah.rodger@ eveningtimes.co.uk
