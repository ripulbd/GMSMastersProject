A FATHER-of-three has launched a new drive to help clothe Glasgow's homeless after getting a second chance at life. Second chance to help others A FATHER-of-three has launched a new drive to help clothe Glasgow's homeless after getting a second chance at life.Forty-nine-year-old Patrick McCurry of Tollcross knows too well the dire situation the homeless face. He spent 10 years on and off the streets as a drug addict.He also had a heart and lung bypass three years ago and said he considers his recovery as &quot;another chance&quot; at life.After being inspired by the food donated by thousands of people in George Square after the referendum, he is starting a new collection for clothing to help the homeless this winter.He started No Place for Poverty Scotland on Facebook on October 8 and already has 20 bags of clothes donated.He said: &quot;At the moment, it's just me and my partner, Agnes Neary.&quot;We grew from Glasgow Needy, the George Square foodbank. People were asking about donating clothes and we thought we would take it on.&quot;He said: &quot;I'm going to get in touch with a woman's refuge near me and see if anyone wants any clothing.&quot;Patrick said he knew what those living on the street were going through.He said: &quot;I've been there. I know they don't go for help. There's still a stigma about being homeless. I would rather go out on the streets and give them jackets or shoes or whatever.&quot;Since he launched his appeal on Facebook, he's had clothing dropped off from across Glasgow.&quot;I had a heart and lung transplant three years ago. Since then, it's like having another chance.&quot;Darren Carnegie of Glasgow Needy said he was pleased it had inspired Patrick and pledged to help in any way he could.He said: &quot;When he got in touch I said I would help.&quot;We are very busy but I will do what I can. We also get given clothes but a lot of people give clothes that aren't suitable to pass on.&quot;Things are going fantastic for us, we took a huge donation to Glasgow City Mission and they were overwhelmed.&quot;Glasgow Needy is not just about us. If we can help other organisations we will.&quot;victoria.brenan@eveningtimes.co.uk
