LORD Prescott, Yvette Cooper, Jack Straw and Peter Hain appeared at a rally in the heart of Glasgow's shopping area. Independence referendum: Labour Party heavyweights arrive in Scotland to join leader Ed Miliband in shoring up support for the union - Daily Record DOZENS of Labour Party heavyweights have arrived in&nbsp;Scotland&nbsp;to join leader Ed Miliband in shoring up support for the union.
Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, former foreign secretary Jack Straw and former Northern Ireland and Welsh secretary Peter Hain appeared at a rally in the heart of Glasgow's shopping area.
Hundreds of pro-union supporters gathered at the top of Buchanan Street for an event that rapidly attracted significant numbers of Yes campaigners.

Mr Miliband and Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont struggled to be heard as they briefly addressed the crowd over chants of Yes and No from both sides.
Better Together leader Alistair Darling also appeared at the event, along with former prime minister Gordon Brown and party peer Lord Foulkes.
Before their arrival, there were some tussles on the steps of the Royal Concert Hall as Yes supporters sought to display their placards alongside the sea of No posters. A passer-by shouted &quot;traitors&quot; at the group.
Gregg McClymont, Labour MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, said: &quot;Colleagues are coming from all over the United Kingdom, from Wales and across England.

&quot;This is people all across Britain saying to us in&nbsp;Scotland, please stay, we are stronger together.
&quot;Solidarity actually matters. Not just solidarity, but we can achieve more together.&quot;
