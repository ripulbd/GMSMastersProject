&quot;Having Commonwealth Games medallist Louise Haston and our ambassador Mark Beaumont along for the ride really added to the occasion and further inspired the riders.
&quot;The 16th year of freshnlo Pedal for Scotland has involved the biggest logistical operation yet and I am looking forward to continuing the cycle buzz in Aberdeen on Sunday September 14 with our free five-mile Family Ride and in Glasgow on Sunday, September 21, with our Family Ride and stunt show at the Velodrome with Danny MacAskill and his 'Drop and Roll' team.&quot;
&quot;We appreciate the patience of businesses and residents along the routes which allowed people to ride across Scotland safely and for barriers to be removed efficiently as soon as possible afterwards.&quot;
