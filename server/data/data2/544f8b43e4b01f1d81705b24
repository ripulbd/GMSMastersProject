Stalwart bowler reaches milestone collecting club cup Janice is named bowling champion for 25th time - Daily Record Janice Maxwell has been crowned champion at Castle Douglas Bowling Club for the 25th time.
Janice has won a championship in all of the last five decades in what is thought to a record in the green bowling world.
She only took up the sport in 1976 and won her first club title in 1978. Since then she has gone from strength to strength bowling locally, nationally and internationally.
She has represented Scotland all over the world and even picked up a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1994 in Canada.
Janice said: “I’ve really enjoyed the sport since I took it up but never thought I would be champion 25 times at my own club or travel all over the world.
“I’m very pleased to win the title again this year at Castle Douglas and to win championships in all of the last five decades is something I never dreamed of.”
After taking up the sport in 1976 Janice won her first club title in 1978 and she represented Scotland internationally from 1986 to 1997 and also won the Scottish singles title in 1986.
She was runner-up in the British Isles championships the following year and in 1990 she was beaten in the fours for the bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland but four years later she won bronze in Canada.
In between the Castle Douglas bowler won gold at the 1992 World Bowls Championships in the triples and fours as well as being a member of the Scotland team that won the gold medal.
The following year she was on a test tour of South Africa and also in 1993 she won a gold medal at the Atlantic Rim Games in Florida and four years later at the same games in Wales she collected a bronze medal.
Janice competes all over the region in tournaments and has many open competition wins to her credit. She has won the South of Scotland Women’s singles title 10 times since 1986.
