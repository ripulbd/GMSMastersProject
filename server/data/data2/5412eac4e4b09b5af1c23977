A TEENAGER has been left with permanent facial scars after what was believed to be an unprovoked assault Teen scarred for life in Clydebank knife attack A TEENAGER has been left with permanent facial scars after what was believed to be an unprovoked assault.

The 16-year-old was attacked at about 4.05am on Saturday while he was waiting for a taxi with two friends, also 16, outside an address in Faifley Road, Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire.
A man approached the three teenagers and started speaking to them, then slashed the victim on the face before walking away.
The victim attended the Western Infirmary in Glasgow and was then transferred to the city’s Southern General Hospital where he received stitches.
Detective Constable Clare Moran said: “This was a horrific attack on a young boy which has left him with permanent facial scarring.
“From what we believe, it was completely unprovoked, neither the victim nor his friends knew the assailant.
“I am appalled that someone would do this then casually walk off.
“It is important that we trace this individual and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area or recognises the distinct description to come forward.”
The man is described as white, aged about 30, 6ft and with a stocky build.
He was wearing a dark Stone Island hooded jacket and had a Rangers scarf around his face.
Anyone with information is asked to contact CID at Clydebank on the non-emergency number 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
