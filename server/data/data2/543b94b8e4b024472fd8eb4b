Bid to turn pitches where David Moyes' played his first game back to their former glory A SPORTS club wants to return the pitches where ex-Manchester United boss David Moyes played his first game to their former glory.Broomhill Sports Club has submitted a bid to transform a neglected part of Victoria Park in the west of the city into a sports facility.The club, which was launched a decade ago, now has more than 750 members and is having to turn people away because it is so full.The volunteer-run group has never had a base and instead uses different sporting venues to accommodate members.It is one of two community groups to submit a bid for the former blaes football pitches in Victoria Park.As the Evening Times reported earlier, Friends of Victoria Park want to see an orchard which would be funded by a community trust.There were fears developers would launch a commercial venture in the green space, such as a pub, shop, or garden centre, after the council decided to rent it out to generate funds.Property consultant Ryden, which undertook a feasibility study into the pitches, is examining both bids before passing them onto the council.Broomhill Sports Club want to build a full size football pitch, a seven-a-side community pitch and dressing room facilities.Chairman Stephen Prince said: &quot;We see it as an opportunity to provide a facility that can be used by all our members and local schools.&quot;We would like to try and evolve and see us introduce new members.&quot;We're turning people away at the moment.&quot;The club was founded in 2004 by parents of youngsters at Broomhill Primary, who were frustrated by the lack of PE classes.Its head coach is Kenny Moyes, brother of football manager and ex-Celtic player David Moyes, who made headlines after he was sacked by Manchester Utd in April - less than 10 months after replacing Sir Alex Ferguson. The family grew up in Thornwood.Stephen said: &quot;The Victoria Park blaes pitches is where David Moyes had his first game. We feel the pitches should always be for sports use.&quot;I don't think a park should be for developing commercially, for some kind of garden centre or a pub.&quot;A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: &quot;We have received two bids and they will be given due diligence.&quot;rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk
