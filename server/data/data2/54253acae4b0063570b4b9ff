A Borders councillor is urging the local authority to take steps to stop the routine deployment of armed police. Bid to block armed police in Borders A Borders councillor is urging the local authority to take steps to stop the routine deployment of armed police.
Vicky Davidson, who represents Selkirkshire, has tabled a motion to the council on the issue.
She said the Borders was a safe place and that carrying side arms was not appropriate or desirable in the region. 
She called for the routine deployment of armed officers to be stopped immediately and only restarted after full consultation in each council area.
Strathclyde Police, Tayside Police and Northern Constabulary allowed specialist officers to carry guns routinely before the creation of the new single force.
Police Scotland adopted the approach across the country following its launch in April last year.
In May this year, independent MSP and former Northern Constabulary officer John Finnie raised concerns about the move.
Highland councillors have also raised concerns about the deployment of officers visibly carrying handguns in routine incidents in a region with low levels of violent crime.
