People aged 11 to 18 are being asked to use their creative skills to inform peers about knife crime and online bullying and abuse through an annual competition.
Schools and youth groups interested in producing artwork, literature and video are being urged to register before the October 30 deadline.
Run by the Scottish Youth Parliament, the We-CTV competition has received more than 3,000 submissions since its launch in 2010.
Brannigan, 28, from Glasgow, said: “By giving young people a voice, allowing them to be creative and help get the message across in a way that their age group understands, We-CTV is a really powerful tool.
“Not only does the competition get young people to think about the consequences of interpersonal violence, it helps them develop skills such as acting, production, creative writing and artwork, which can really help them in later life.
“I look forward to seeing this year’s entries.”
Scottish Youth Parliament member David Stewart said: “Through our consultation work, we know that young people believe the solutions to solving the problem of knife crime lie in working with young people to tackle the root causes.
“The competition has been developed to encourage young people to think about these issues, and through creative skills, shape discussions on solutions on anti-violence messages.”
