Fugitive Drumchapel thug Kelly linked with shooting MACHETE thug Jonathan Kelly has been linked with a gun attack on a family home.A crazed shooter opened fire at the wrong house in an Edinburgh street - just 24 hours after police issued an appeal for Kelly to hand himself in.The 34-year-old Glasgow fugitive - now one of Britain's most wanted men - has been on the run for a month, since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.It is believed the gunman was targeting a rival but shot at the wrong house in Drum Brae Terrace, on Friday night.A source close to the investigation said the shooter was believed to have targeted the house &quot;by mistake&quot;.Police said a man wearing a light coloured top and black jogging bottoms was seen in the area at around 11.30pm. A car was also spotted being driven off the road and on to a grassy area nearby.Police have repeatedly said Kelly is no danger to the public but he was at the centre of an armed siege in Glasgow just weeks ago.Armed police responded to a reported sighting of him and sealed off part of Boyd Street in Govanhill.The thug, from Drumchapel, has been in and out of jail since the late 1990s. He has been put behind bars for numerous violent crimes, including serious assaults, robbery, and an assault to severe injury.Kelly is believed to be armed and it is understood that, because of the risk he poses, firearms officers will be drafted in as soon as he is spotted.Meanwhile, the Crimestoppers charity is offering a &pound;1000 reward in a bid to snare the serial offender.Detective Superintendent Stevie Grant, of Greater Glasgow Division CID, urged anyone helping Kelly to give him up.He said: &quot;Consider the additional pressure harbouring Mr Kelly will place on you and your family as time goes on, and you come to the attention of the police.&quot;I would discourage the general public from approaching him or engaging with him as he prefers to spend time on his own.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
