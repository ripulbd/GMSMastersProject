The four robbers entered the Argyll Arcade, a jewellery gallery off Buchanan Street, armed with hammers and axes at 12.45pm.
Eyewitnesses said that the attackers knocked over a security guard, hit him with a baseball bat and smashed windows.
Staff tripped an alarm within one shop, which sent smoke billowing out into the tiled passageway.
The robbers were described as wearing balaclavas and dressed in a mixture of grey and black clothing.
Escaping from the arcade, they ran off on to Buchanan Street and down a nearby lane.
One eyewitness said she saw attempts to break windows at Mappin and Webb jewellers and Laings of Glasgow.

Recordings

People standing in Buchanan Street recorded the robbery using their phone cameras,
capturing striking images of the robbers silhouetted against the smoke as they attempted to smash open shop windows with the hammers and axes.
Footage appeared on the social media website YouTube shortly after, which showed one of the arcadeâ€™s top-hatted concierges trying to direct members of public out of the building away from the curtain of smoke that had enveloped the corridor.
The thieves emerges sprinting from the clouds, charge out into Buchanan Street, watched by some 30 onlookers, and down a lane on the left hand side of the building that contains the arcade.
The arcade was locked down throughout the afternoon, and an area of the street outside cordoned off with police guards while staff were questioned.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said they were investigating reports of a robbery at the arcade.
