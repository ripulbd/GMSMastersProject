Parents hit at plan for baby ashes PARENTS at the centre of Glasgow's baby ashes scandal have said a new report does not go far enough to help them.Those who were told they could not collect their child's remains have said the findings of the city council's Infant Cremation Working Group are just a &quot;box ticking exercise&quot;.As reported in yesterday's Evening Times, the committee has released its plans to make sure no family will suffer the agony of not knowing the location of their child's remains. The plans include using baby trays for all infant and baby cremations at Linn and Daldowie Crematoria. Ashes are now defined as all that remains following the cremation process.Linsay Bonar lost her baby, Lachlan, in 2006 and has campaigned for an apology to parents from the council.She said: &quot;The overwhelming feeling is that once again they are responsible to themselves and not to the parents who are affected and not responsible to the public.&quot;Reviews are not being carried out by external agencies. To be only accountable to yourself is not a step in the right direction.&quot;I have met council officials many times and have never received an apology - they do not seem to acknowledge they have done anything wrong.&quot;Although the baby trays are welcome, this is just a box ticking exercise.&quot;Other council changes has seen forms and paperwork revised to make sure they can be clearly and easily understood by all cremation applicants.Bereavement management from the council have also met funeral directors and NHS managers to make sure those who are dealing with the public can properly describe processes to bereaved parents.Stacey Lamb Stacey, from Tollcross, was the first to reveal her ordeal of the loss of her son, Daniel. She said: &quot;In a way this is progress because it won't happen to any other families again, but that doesn't help us, now.&quot;This brings home to us we were let down, but in a way I am happy other parents will not go through this, but it is hard to know I could have had something after all.&quot;A council spokesman said: &quot;We welcomed, and quickly adopted, the Infant Cremation Commission's interpretation of ashes as 'all that remains following the cremation process'. By using this definition it very likely we will return any ash to bereaved families, where they request it.&quot;catriona.stewart@eveningtimes.co.uk
