FIFTY firefighters are tackling a blaze which spread rapidly through a large building.


Emergency services were called to the blaze near the M74 in Glasgow shortly before 5pm.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said it received a large number of repeat calls from members of the public to the blaze at Jessie Street, off Polmadie Road.
The SFRS said firefighters from Polmadie community fire station arrived at the scene within minutes and were faced with a “rapidly spreading fire within a large building” measuring around 150m x 100m.
“The initial officer in charge immediately requested further resources to deal with the fire and there are currently 50 firefighters responding to the incident,” a spokesman said.
Crews have been using large bore firefighting hoses and two high reach appliances to tackle the flames.
Polmadie Road has been closed and motorists are being warned of significant traffic disruption in the area. Reports suggested smoke has been drifting across the M74, causing delays.
There are no reports of any injuries.
“We have no information at this time to suggest there is anyone in the building,” the SFRS spokesman confirmed.
