A man was arrested after being caught on video wrestling with police before flooring one and running off in handcuffs along a train station platform Video: handcuffed man makes freedom bid A man was arrested after being caught on video wrestling with police before flooring one and running off in handcuffs along a train station platform.

Martin Crawford, 24, was restrained by a policewoman while he hurled obscentities at her male colleague. 
Despite being handcuffed behind his back, Crawford then shrugs the male officer to the ground before escaping along the platform with the cops in hot pursuit.
Ryan Leitch, 15, from Glasgow, witnessed the dramatic scene unfold at Clydebank train station and recorded it on his mobile phone. The short recording has now being shared almost 7,000 times on Facebook.
Ryan said: “I was at the train station and went to see why the police were there. I saw what was happening and took a video because it was quite funny.
“The guy was swearing at the cop. The other guy in the black top is his friend. I don’t know them.
“I put the video up just two minutes after it happened and now a lot of people have seen it.”
The video ends with the officer getting to his feet and chasing down the handcuffed thug down the platform.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “We can confirm that at 14.00 on 30 August 2014 two males, aged 24 and 25, were arrested for various offences including drinking in public and resisting arrest.”
Both men appeared at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
Crawford received an 80-hour community payback order after he was found guilty of breaching the peace and resisting arrest charges.
Ryan Allan, 25, walked free after pleading not guilty to breaching the peace, obstructing police officers and drinking in public.
