FORMER Rangers player Sone Aluko is among those fronting a new campaign to tackle match-fixing in football.

Aluko, a Nigeria internationalist, is one of a number of high-profile stars taking part in the new initiative between Interpol and Fifa - the sport’s governing body - which seeks to educate players about the dangers of getting involved with organised crime gangs.

Earlier this year, a friendly between Scotland and Nigeria was at the centre of a match-fixing probe after the National Crime Agency contacted the Scottish Football Association in the run-up to the match. 
Aluko, who now plays for Hull City, appears on a new DVD being launched today, alongside Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard and Liverpool defender Kolo Tour&eacute;.
The DVD, which has been produced by Interpol, is part of a campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of match manipulation and seeks to provide “positive role models” for players.
Theo van Seggelen, secretary general of FIFPro, the players’ union, said: “Fifa, Interpol and FIFPro have already initiated significant initiatives in the past.
“By concentrating our resources, we can take our efforts to protect the integrity of the game and its actors to a new level.”
Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke added: “We appeal to all football participants to contribute towards promoting transparency and integrity through vigilance and a sense of responsibility, and help protect football.
