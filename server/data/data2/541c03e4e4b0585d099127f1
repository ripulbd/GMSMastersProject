Cherry-picker overturned  after going off the edge of a concrete plinth at the Annick Water viaduct outside Stewarton Company fined after horror accident at Stewarton viaduct which killed worker - Daily Record A Glasgow-based company has been fined &pound;200,000 over the death of a worker thrown from a cherry-picker on the outskirts of Stewarton.
The cherry-picker overturned after going off the edge of a concrete plinth at the Annick Water viaduct outside Stewarton on April 13, 2010.
SW Global Resourcing admitted at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court breaching health and safety laws over the death of 47-year-old Leslie Watson from Alloa.
Mr Watson died at the scene from his injuries after the raised platform overturned and he plunged 70 feet into the water below. He had been carrying out maintenance work on behalf of Network Rail, who operate the Kilmarnock to Glasgow line, with a view to the viaduct being strengthened.
The court heard on Monday that the accident could have been avoided if adequate precautions had been taken.
Both the Office of Rail Regulation and the Health and Safety Executive found that plinths, put in place to create a level working surface, did not have any end stop or edge protection.
The cherry-picker had gone off the edge of a plinth and overturned.
Gary Aitken, head of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal health and safety division, said: “SW Global Resourcing Limited accepted liability and the Crown accepted their guilty plea to the contraventions of the Health &amp; Safety at Work Act 1974.
“The company failed to ensure the safety of its employees and as a result of this Leslie Watson died.
“This was an entirely avoidable tragedy which has left family and friends devastated at the loss of a loved one.”
ORR railway safety director Ian Prosser said: “Safety of those working and travelling on the railways will always be ORR’s number one priority and where failings are found the regulator will not hesitate to take action.”
