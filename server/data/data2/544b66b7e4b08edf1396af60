SHE had endured four shunt operations on her brain before her first birthday. Brave Milli won't let her illness limit her life SHE had endured four shunt operations on her brain before her first birthday.But, despite the odds, little battler Milli Hamilton is about to mark her sixth birthday.And the day will be a double celebration, as it also marks six years that her family has been supported by the Scottish Spina Bifida Association (SSBA).Mum Caroline said: &quot;The charity has been fantastic and really supportive. We have a visit at home once a week from our key support worker from the SSBA and we go to their Family Support Centre every week too.&quot;For Milli, it means she doesn't feel so alone and can socialise with other children who have the same condition and challenges.&quot;They even have a specialist dance class there that helps the children with their movement.&quot;It also means I get to meet other parents who are in the same position as me.We can support each other and discuss all kinds of things that parents whose children don't have spina bifida and hydrocephalus would know nothing about.&quot;Milli, who is six next month, was diagnosed with spina bifida at 32 weeks into her mum's pregnancy and was born with both spina bifida and hydrocephalus.Before she was one year old, she had four shunt operations to her head, as well as major surgery to close the hole in her back.Though she is paralysed from the waist down, uses a wheelchair and has additional bowel and bladder problems, which means she has to be catheterised every four hours, this determined youngster does anything she sets her mind to.Caroline, from Uddingston, added: &quot;I can't thank the fundraisers out there enough - whether they have run a marathon, baked cakes or even swum with sharks to raise money for the SSBA, their efforts have changed my daughter's life for ever.&quot;They have raised awareness of the condition and have helped fund a vital support team that are there for so many children and families in Scotland when they need it most.&quot;Thanks to their efforts my Milli doesn't feel different any more. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&quot;Today marks this year's international awareness day for spina bifida and the charity is appealing for support. More than 3500 Scottish children, young adults and families benefit from the support of the SSBA, including 444 in Glasgow.As one of Scotland's longest running self-funding charity, it has to raise more than &pound;1million every year from donations and events staged by the public and themselves to support people in Scotland facing the challenging and lifelong condition of spina bifida, for which there is no cure.Consultant geneticist, and a former Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year, Dr Margo Whiteford, chairwoman of the SSBA who was born with spina bifida, said: &quot;Spina bifida is one the most common severe birth defects, and the prevalence of the condition in Scotland is one of the highest in Europe.&quot;Unlike England, where 90% of pregnancies are terminated when the condition is diagnosed during pregnancy, 50% of pregnancies are terminated in Scotland. The reasons are thought to be both cultural and religious.&quot;With A Little Help From Our Friends, the Scottish Spina Bifida Association's intensive fundraising and awareness week, runs until Sunday November 2.To find out how to help, go to www.ssba.org.ukThe charity also runs a confidential helpline on 08459 11 11 12.
