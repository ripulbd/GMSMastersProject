Capita to create 200 new jobs in Glasgow Over 200 new jobs will be created in Glasgow by one of the country's largest private sector employers, the First Minister has announced.Almost &pound;11 million will be invested to expand Capita plc, which already employs around 5,000 people in Scotland in areas including IT, telecoms, utilities and financial services.The organisation plans to invest almost &pound;5 million expanding Capita Customer Management Ltd (CCM) and a further &pound;6 million growing its IT services division.The company's investment is also aided by two grants from public body Scottish Enterprise totalling &pound;1.24 million.Alex Salmond met with the firm's business development director Gordon Lee as part of a programme of business engagement during the Ryder Cup.Mr Salmond said: &quot;Scotland's performance in the finance and business sector continues to go from strength to strength and Capita's multimillion-pound investment is further evidence of the confidence in our workforce.&quot;International companies estimate general cost savings of around 30-40% can be achieved in Scotland when comparing similar operational, property and employment costs to London. In fact, the most recent Ernst and Young survey revealed Scotland once again as the top destination in the UK for foreign direct investment, outperforming every other part of the UK.&quot;Capita, as one of our largest employers, already employ thousands of people across Scotland and I welcome their commitment to create an additional 200 jobs in Glasgow and the number of other ventures planned in coming years.&quot;Mr Lee said: &quot;Our presence in Scotland has grown significantly in the last few years and this investment demonstrates Capita's continued focus in the country.&quot;We look forward to building on this, helping our customers transform their business delivery, creating even more jobs in the future and supporting local communities over the coming years.&quot;
