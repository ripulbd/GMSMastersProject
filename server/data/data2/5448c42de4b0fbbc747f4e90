FUGITIVE machete thug Jonathan Kelly may have had a ­complete makeover, a police insider said. Makeover bid by fugitive to avoid capture FUGITIVE machete thug Jonathan Kelly may have had a ­complete makeover, a police insider said.Detectives are desperate to nail the 34-year-old, from Drumchapel, who has been on the run for six weeks, since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.Police revealed he may have shaved his head or grown a beard in a bid to disguise himself.One source close to the investigation said: &quot;My suspicion is that Mr &shy;Kelly no longer looks like he does in that picture.&quot;It was taken the day he was released, but he could have a different haircut, different hair colour, lost weight and be wearing a completely different style of clothes.&quot;A full inquiry team is continuing to work to &quot;flush out&quot; Kelly, who uses a &quot;number of aliases&quot; including Donald Cameron, John Kerr, and Jonathan Donnelly.Police admit there have been no positive sightings of Britain's most wanted man for six weeks.Despite high hopes for a breakthrough following a BBC Crimewatch appeal last week, the &shy;inquiry appears to be no further forward.Police Scotland last made a public plea for &shy;information on Friday, October 10, when senior police tried to connect with the fugitive through the media.In a direct appeal to Kelly, Detective Superintendent Stevie Grant, of Greater Glasgow Division CID, said: &quot;You may feel that you have been portrayed incorrectly.&quot;However you have this opportunity to set the record the straight.&quot;Police believe someone has information about Kelly's whereabouts - but is helping to keep him one step ahead of officers.Associates, who may be harbouring Kelly, have also been urged to give him up.Mr Grant said: &quot;Consider the additional &shy;pressure harbouring Mr Kelly will place on you and your family as time goes on, and you come to the &shy;attention of the police.&quot;Crimestoppers has also stumped up a &pound;1000 reward in a bid to snare the serial offender.Police have repeatedly said Kelly is no danger to the public but he was the focus of an armed siege in Glasgow just weeks ago.Armed police responded to a reported sighting of him and sealed off part of Boyd Street in Govanhill.Kelly is believed to be armed and it is understood that, because of the risk he poses, firearms officers will be drafted in as soon as he is spotted.rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk
