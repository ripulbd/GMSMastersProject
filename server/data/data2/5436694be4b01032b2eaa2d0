NICOLA Sturgeon has claimed enthusiasm for independence in Scotland will not be dampened in the event of Westminster delivering on its powers promise.The Glasgow Southside MSP, who is expected to become First Minister in the next few weeks after Alex Salmond steps down, said voters will grow more confident in the country as further powers are devolved.The Deputy First Minister spoke out after the Prime Minister vowed again to keep his pre-referendum promise to fast-track more powers to Scotland.However, Ms Sturgeon said the focus for now was making sure that promises would be delivered - or they would face a &quot;very angry backlash&quot;.She said: &quot;I think there will always be a demand for independence. I believe Scotland will become an independent country. I think the more powers that are delivered, the more the confidence in our ability as a country to govern our affairs will grow.&quot;But it's circumstances that will dictate the pace of that progress: the focus now, in light of the referendum result, is to make sure those promises are delivered.&quot;I think if the Westminster parties renege on those promises or fall short of delivering what the people in Scotland thought was being committed they'll face a very angry backlash from voters.&quot;David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed a joint vow days before the September 18 referendum for a cross-party deal, which would devolve more powers to Scotland.On Sunday Mr Cameron told the Andrew Marr Show: &quot;Let me be clear we must keep our vows and we will keep our vows to the people of Scotland that they will have a stronger Scottish Parliament with stronger powers over taxation, over welfare, over spending.&quot;Ms Sturgeon said it was members of the public energised by the recent vote who would hold politicians to account.She said: &quot;There has been a great democratic energy released by the referendum campaign.&quot;There's people who have never before been involved in political, public or civic life suddenly saying: 'You know what? It feels good to be involved and to be in charge of our own future'.&quot;
