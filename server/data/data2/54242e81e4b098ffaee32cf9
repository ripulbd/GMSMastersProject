Police drive to keep students safe Students returning to university and college are being urged to stay safe online and in everyday life as part of a new police campaign.About 465,000 new and returning students are beginning their studies across Scotland this week and are often the targets of crime.An advertising campaign in campuses and social media is aiming to highlight issues to the thousands of young people adapting to their new surroundings and lifestyles.Throughout freshers week officers will be giving advice to students on how to keep their property and valuables safe, protecting themselves from identity theft, online scams and the health and legal implications of substance abuse.Police want to raise awareness of potential issues that can emerge in renting and sharing accommodation, partying on nights out and social media.The four-week campaign will run alongside a number of policing initiatives throughout the country and includes posters, online adverts and an information booklet available in paper form or as a download.Superintendent Daniel Hatfield said: &quot;Starting university or college means some huge life changes.&quot;Police Scotland wants to support students in embracing student life by providing advice on how to avoid becoming a victim of crime and help keep people safe.&quot;Getting the personal safety message across to students is extremely important as many of these students may be moving away from home for the first time.&quot;Police Scotland is aware of the impact that these changes can have on students and whilst we want to make sure that students have a safe and enjoyable time in our towns and cities, we hope that this campaign will help more students to keep safe by avoiding becoming victims of crime and by highlighting the issues they may face.&quot;
