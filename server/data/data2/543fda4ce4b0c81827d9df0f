DECKED out with GoPro camera one commuter attempts to prove that Glasgow man really is quicker than Glasgow Underground. Watch cheeky 'Race the Tube' clip of man taking on the Glasgow Subway on foot - Daily Record

YOU may have seen the viral video of the man who raced the London Underground between two stations on foot - and won.
Well here’s a typically gallus Glasgow version of ‘Race the Tube’ as one commuter takes on the subway system lovingly dubbed ‘the clockwork orange’ in the west end of the city.
Jumping off at Hillhead Station on Byres Road and heading towards Kelvinbridge the fleet footed runner decked out with GoPro camera proves you apparently don’t need to be Usain Bolt to beat the Glasgow underground.
Not only does he stop off for a pint or two on the way he also checks out a number of tourist attractions en-route to the next station - and still makes it in time. Allegedly.
The cheeky clip was put together by Tennent’s Lager and is sure to bring a wry smile to the face of Glaswegians. Watch the clip above.
