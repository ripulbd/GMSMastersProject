 St Mirren had six players on the treatment table following the League Cup defeat by Partick Thistle but all have a chance of playing on Saturday. 
 Jason Naismith and John McGinn are back training after missing the Firhill loss through illness while skipper Steven Thompson is a long-term absentee. 
 Celtic winger Mubarak Wakaso returns after missing the last two games. 
 Charlie Mulgrew (knee), James Forrest (hamstring), Mikael Lustig (groin) and Adam Matthews (calf) remain out. 
  St Mirren striker Callum Ball (speaking to his club website):  &quot;If we can repeat the second half against Partick Thistle, I think we can beat any team in the league. We worked hard as a unit and dug in and pressed well. 
 &quot;If we play like that against Celtic I feel we can give them a good run for their money and put them under pressure, and hopefully nick three points. 
 &quot;It's nice to play a big team like Celtic. I feel we can get three points.&quot; 
  Celtic manager Ronny Deila:  &quot;We know how good we are when we are on top form. 
 &quot;We go into matches knowing that if we are performing at 100 per cent then it is very hard to beat us. 
 &quot;So I am really looking forward to this game to build on what we did against Hearts. 
 &quot;There are so many games to come. We know our tasks and goals, that has been clear from the start and that has not changed.&quot;
