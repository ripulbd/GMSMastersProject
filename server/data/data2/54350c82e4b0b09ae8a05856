HMS Artful, a 97m-long 7,400-tonne nuclear-powered vessel is one of seven being built by BAE Systems in Barrow.
During the &quot;trim and incline test&quot;, it was submerged to allow naval architects to calculate its precise weight and centre of gravity and prove its safety and stability in the water.
BAE Systems described the operation as a &quot;significant milestone&quot;.
The first two submarines in the Astute class, HMS Astute and HMS Ambush, have now been handed over to the Royal Navy.
Four others - Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and the yet to be named seventh - are in various stages of construction.
They are capable of circumnavigating the world without the need to resurface.
Tony Johns, managing director of BAE Systems Submarines said: &quot;Successfully completing the trim and incline test is a significant milestone for Artful and a result of years of work by skilled engineers, naval architects and our operations team.
&quot;Our focus is now on completing final test and commissioning activities before she leaves Barrow for sea trials next year.&quot;
