Book tribute to a 'modest' soldier THE great-granddaughter of one of Glasgow's First World War Victoria Cross recipients was presented with a special book detailing his heroism.Private Henry May, a reservist with the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), braved a &quot;hail of lead&quot; to rescue soldiers, including his platoon commander, at La Boutillerie, France, on October 22, 1914.Modest about his &shy;actions, Private May, from Bridgeton, later said: &quot;I just did what any man in the regiment would have done to bring in a wounded man.&quot;King George presented Mr May with his V ictoria Cross - the highest honour to be awarded for gallantry - on August 12, 1915.Jennifer McInnes, his great-grand-daughter, joined Lord Provost Sadie Docherty to &shy;honour her ancestor.The heroic soldier has been researched by Jack Murray, a Scots Guard veteran and former police officer.The amateur historian, who has been researching VC recipients, presented Ms McInnes and Mrs &shy;Docherty with a copy each of the book he compiled on behalf of the Scots Guards Association.Ms McInnes said: &quot;I was a child when I found out that my great-grandfather had won a Victoria Cross and I have always felt very proud and compelled to find out more about him.&quot;I feel grateful and very touched that Mr Murray chose my &shy;ancestor as one of the VC recipients he researched.&quot;Through this book I have discovered information that had previously been unknown to my family, including Henry's attendance at the burial of the Unknown Warrior and the unveiling of the Cenotaphs at both Westminster and George Square.&quot;The book will be placed in the City Chambers archives.rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk
