A man has been charged with murdering a Scottish comedian almost 17 years after he was found dead at his Glasgow home. Graham Fraser charged with murdering comedian Hugh Ferris A man has been charged with murdering a Scottish comedian almost 17 years after he was found dead at his Glasgow home.
Graham Fraser, 52, is alleged to have broken into 58-year-old Hugh Ferris's flat in Pollokshields in December 1997.
It is claimed that Mr Fraser and Donald Murray, who is now dead, attacked the entertainer, robbed him and left him tied up without seeking medical help.
Mr Fraser, who was charged after a cold case review, was not present during the hearing. The case was adjourned.
The indictment claims a chisel was held against Mr Ferris's neck before he was repeatedly punched, his hands and feet bound with electrical cable and his pockets rifled through. 
It is further alleged a telephone cable was pulled from a socket and that no attempt was made to get medical help. 
The murder charge also claims Mr Ferris was then abandoned while he was tied up and unable to get assistance. 
Mr Fraser, from the Govanhill area, was not present during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow. 
His lawyer George Gebbie said defence inquiries were ongoing and asked for a further hearing to be set. 
Judge Lord Bannatyne adjourned the case until next month. 
Mr Fraser was charged after a report was sent to the procurator fiscal in 2012 following a cold case review into Mr Ferris's death. 
Mr Ferris had once been a popular entertainer in Glasgow's pubs and clubs where he was known for telling jokes and his singing. 
Scots actor and close friend Peter Mullan once put up a &pound;5,000 reward for information into his death. 
Mullan had given Mr Ferris a role in his film Orphans, but he died before it was released.
