Scottish Water is urging householders to protect their homes as the cold weather begins to bite. Pipes advice as weather turns cold Scottish Water is urging householders to protect their homes as the cold weather begins to bite.Winter temperatures can lead to frozen and burst pipes in properties that are not adequately insulated, the company warned.People can also reduce their energy bills this winter by using less water, with Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change figures showing that 18% of domestic energy is used for heating water.Scottish Water issued the advice in the latest phase of an awareness campaign to reduce the 40,000 drain and sewer blockages it dealt with last year at a cost of &pound;7 million.Cooking fat, nappies, cotton buds and wipes were the main offenders after being put down sinks and toilets.They combine to produce a mass of solidified fat and material which can clog up pipes and lead to the flooding of homes and gardens and pollution of rivers and burns.Spokesman Chris Wallace said: &quot;A new addition to this phase is our advert to encourage everyone to get prepared and follow our winter code to heat and insulate their home or business now to help protect against frozen or burst pipes in colder, winter weather.&quot;Last winter was mild with very little in the way of extreme temperatures, snow and ice, and after a quiet and warm summer, it would be a mistake for us to be lulled into thinking we may be in line for another mild winter.&quot;Over the last five years the winter season has been very volatile, going between very cold and very mild conditions, and it is important we take these sensible and simple actions to protect our homes and businesses against the elements.&quot;Information for householders on how to prepare their property for winter is available at www.scottishwater.co.uk/winter
