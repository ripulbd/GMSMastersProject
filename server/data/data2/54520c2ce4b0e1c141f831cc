HOSPITAL bosses want to increase the number of parking spaces at the new Southern General, the Health Secretary said. Bosses ask for more parking at city hospital HOSPITAL bosses want to increase the number of parking spaces at the new Southern General, the Health Secretary said.The number of cars expected to come to the area when the adult and children's hospitals are complete has caused controversy, with staff concerned they won't be able to park and local people fearing their streets will be overrun with cars.Health Secretary Alex Neil said the health board is providing the maximum allowed, and looking to balance the needs of staff, patients and visitors and a workforce travel plan in place for public transport.Mr Neil was asked by Glasgow Labour MSP Drew Smith if he considered parking provision to be adequate and safe for staff at the new site.Mr Smith asked if there was a workforce travel plan and if it was adequate, and what concerns had been raised about the safety of staff who can't park at the hospital or in side streets.Mr Neil said plans were in place concerning safety for motorist and public transport users, and management and union representatives have mechanisms to discuss any safety concerns.He said: &quot;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have outlined the provision of 3500 car parking spaces following completion of a third multi-storey car park in the summer of 2016, the maximum number of spaces permitted by the planning consent for the new hospitals and laboratory facilities.&quot;However it was hoped that could be increased by almost 15% to allow more flexibility.He added: &quot;The Board is in continued dialogue with planners to look at whether there is any scope to increase the number of spaces from 3500 to 4000 as part of the final master planning of the site.&quot;To encourage more people to leave their cars at home, Mr Neil said there were loans available to allow staff to save on tickets on public transport including the new Fastlink, which will run from the city centre to the hospital via the Squinty Bridge.He said &pound;5.2million had been invested in the work-force travel plan to improve and promote the use of mini transport interchanges across the city to connect to the hospital.Partick Interchange is seen as crucial for people living in the west of the city to connect with Fastlink at Govan Subway, one stop away.Safety fears had been raised including staff walking to and from car parks on the site and to cars parked in the wider area if car parks are full.Mr Neil said Glasgow City Council is making improvements to street lighting in the area and community wardens in the area had made streets safer.He said CCTV has been installed in the Clyde Tunnel to improve safety for cyclists and on public transport throughout the city.Earlier this month the Evening Times revealed plans to charge residents to park outside their homes near the new hospital.The council is considering a West End-style controlled parking scheme for Govan which is expected to cost each householder &pound;50 a year.The new &pound;842million South Glasgow Hospital campus will employ more than 10,000 staff.stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
