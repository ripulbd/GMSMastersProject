Mum to launch charity after losing twin son A MOTHER who lost one of her twin boys during pregnancy is planning to launch a charity to raise money and awareness of the disease which killed her baby.Louise Chisholm hopes to help other women diagnosed with twin to twin transfusion syndrome, a disease of the placenta.The 29-year-old was forced to travel to Birmingham by train for a complicated intrauterine laser &shy;surgery on the placenta &shy;because the operation isn't available in Scotland.Louise, from Cathkin, south east Glasgow, had no choice but to have the &shy;operation because without it she was warned both &shy;babies could die.After the operation, Louise was then sent home on a train after being told her babies could still be at risk.A day after returning from England, Louise was taken to Glasgow's Princess Royal Hospital where she found out little Samuel had passed away, but she still had to carry him in her womb until Jack was born.Louise struggled through the pregnancy by convincing herself that both her sons would be fine which was the only way she could cope with her nightmare ordeal.Jack was 3lb 7oz when he was born and he spent three months in ICU while his mum prepared a funeral service for his brother who weighed only 11oz.Now Louise wants to use her experience to make sure other parents get the support they need and help to pay for transport down south for the operation.She plans to launch her twin to twin transfusion syndrome charity over the next few months and is looking for volunteers and donations to get it off the ground.Louise has already sought advice from other children's charities who have shown her how to go about it.She added: &quot;I feel very passionately about this and I'm determined to get a charity off the ground.&quot;There needs to be &shy;something out there to raise awareness and also to help parents both &shy;emotionally and financially when they are faced with having to go down south for the procedure.&quot;I'll be campaigning and holding charity events as well and I need all the help I can get so volunteers and donations would be great.&quot;I've been speaking to other charities to get more information about setting up a charity which helps children with heart disorders have been great.&quot;If you would like to offer your help or donate to Louise's awareness campaign contact you can contact her by e-mail at louise.chisholm@live.co.uk or via https://www.facebook.com/louise.chisholm.9 on her &shy;Facebook page.janice.burns@eveningtimes.co.uk
