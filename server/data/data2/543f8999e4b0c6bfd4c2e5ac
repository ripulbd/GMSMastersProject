LibDems back chemo battle A WIDOWER'S 10-year fight for chemotherapy services to be re-instated at Stobhill Hospital has been given fresh hope.Tom Herbert has gained the backing of Scots LibDem leader Willie Rennie and the party's health spokesman, Jim Hume MSP.The pair are to table a questions today at the Scottish Parliament, backing his case.The service was provided at the old Stobhill but did not form part of services when the new &pound;100million hospital opened in 2012, despite being part of the original plans.Instead, chemotherapy services were provided in the new Victoria Infirmary.Since then, patients from the north of Glasgow as well as parts of East Dunbartonshire have had to travel to Glasgow's Beatson for treatment.Mr Herbert, 75, from Lenzie, launched his campaign after his late wife Margaret was treated for breast cancer at the old Stobhill and later at the Beatson.He said: &quot;The distances to the Beatson are totally unacceptable to sick people when an outreach facility could easily be made available at our local hospital.&quot;People from areas of the north of Glasgow are also missing out.&quot;LibDem health spokesman Jim Hume said: &quot;Undergoing chemotherapy is a gruelling and stressful time. If the stress and inconvenience of travelling up to two hours for some patients can be tackled, then NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde must act.&quot;NHSGGC has ruled out re-instating a full day chemotherapy service at Stobhill.A spokeswoman said: &quot;One of the clinical working groups is looking at how we can deliver oral chemotherapy as close to the patient as possible. This work is ongoing.&quot;caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
