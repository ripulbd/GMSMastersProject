Teenager left scarred for life after being slashed on the face as he waited on a taxi with pals - Daily Record DETECTIVES are hunting a knife thug after a teenager was slashed in an unprovoked attack.
The 16-year-old victim was waiting on a taxi with two friends outside a block of flats in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire when a man in his 30s started talking to them.
But as they chatted the yob pulled out a knife and slashed the boy on the face.
His pals, also 16, were not injured.
The victim was treated at the Southern General in Glasgow and released.
Police Scotland said the attack, which has left the teenager scarred for life, was unprovoked.
Police said the thug walked off after the slashing.
The suspect is described as white, aged 30 years, 6ft and of stocky build.
He was wearing a dark coloured “Stone Island” hooded jacket and had a Rangers scarf around his face
Detective Constable Clare Moran at Clydebank CID said: &quot;This was a horrific attack on a young boy which has left him with permanent facial scarring.&nbsp;
&quot;From what we believe, it was completely unprovoked, neither the victim nor his friends knew the assailant.&nbsp;
&quot;I am appalled that someone would do this then casually walk off.
“It is important that we trace this individual and I would appeal to anyone who was in the area or recognises the distinct description to come forward.”
The victim attended the Western Infirmary in Glasgow and was then transferred to the city's Southern General Hospital where he received stitches.
Anyone with information is asked to phone Clydebank CID on the non emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
