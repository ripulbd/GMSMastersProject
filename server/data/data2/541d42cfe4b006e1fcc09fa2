SHIPYARD bosses threatened to move operations from the Clyde to Cumbria if Scots voted for independence, it's been claimed. Yes 'would have sent yard jobs south' SHIPYARD bosses threatened to move operations from the Clyde to Cumbria if Scots voted for independence, it's been claimed.Union leaders say the threats had been repeatedly suggested in the run-up to the referendum but refused to go public for fear of being accused of trying to influence the outcome.Today it can be revealed how senior figures at BAE Systems, which owns both the Scotstoun and Govan yards, had warned that shipbuilding would be switched from Glasgow to Barrow-in-Furness.The North of England seaport is already used by the defence contractor to build submarines and was seen as an ideal location for the construction of warships.The transfer was drawn up as a contingency plan after high-level Westminster politicians made it clear that an independent Scotland would not be handed lucrative contracts of new warships.One senior union official told the Evening Times during the campaign: &quot;A Yes vote will sound the death knell of shipbuilding on the Clyde. BAE have made it clear that their new frigate factory will be built at Barrow and that operations on the Clyde will be axed.&quot;Another said on the day Scotland rejected independence: &quot;It's true that in conversations with management we were left with the distinct impression that the entire operation on the Clyde would be moved to Barrow. Frankly, there was a real fear of wholesale redundancies but we decided not to go public.&quot;We did not want to be accused of scaremongering. To say we are pleased with today's outcome would be an understatement.&quot;BAE chiefs on the Clyde refused to comment. The claims come months after they axed 800 jobs when work on steel blocks for the new HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier ended.gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
