 The 22-year-old Sweden international is currently on a season-long loan from Manchester City, where his contract expires in the summer. 
 &quot;We're talking with everybody around him and him also, and he's positive,&quot; said the Celtic manager. 
 &quot;His confidence is fantastic. At once, he was a star amongst the fans and this looks like his home.&quot; 
 Guidetti has scored five goals in seven games since arriving at Celtic Park. 
 After his latest strike in a 2-0 win at home to Kilmarnock on Saturday, the forward said he believes Celtic can win the quadruple this season - the domestic treble plus the Europa League. 
 On that subject, Deila admitted it is a &quot;high goal&quot; but that anything is possible. 
 &quot;It's important to have high ambitions,&quot; said the manager who has now been in charge of Celtic for 20 competitive matches, winning 11 of them. 
 Looking ahead to Wednesday's League Cup quarter-final at home against Partick Thistle, Deila stated it is &quot;vital&quot; Celtic win it as they seek to secure the domestic treble. 
 &quot;It's one of the three competitions we can win here in Scotland and we need to win on Wednesday if we're going to win the trophy,&quot; the Norwegian said. 
 &quot;I'm looking forward to it, it's a very important game. This is the first [trophy] we can win and it's very important for me and the whole club - we'll do everything we can to do it. 
 &quot;Everybody here wants to win the treble. You have to believe and if you don't believe, nothing will happen.&quot;
