Temporary roof fitted at fire-hit Glasgow School of Art A temporary roof is being installed on Glasgow School of Art's fire-damaged Mackintosh building in a bid to keep it wind and watertight over the winter.
The week-long operation will see a large metal frame hoisted on to the building on Tuesday before white protective panels are fitted.
The Grade-A listed structure has dried out over the summer since fire crews battled to contain a blaze on 23 May.
The art school hopes to raise &pound;20m to restore the iconic building.
Firefighters managed to save about 90% of the structure and 70% of its contents, although the Mackintosh library was among the most badly-damaged areas.
Glasgow School of Art (GSA) is hosting two symposia to explore key questions around the rebuilding of the historically important library.
One will be held in Venice on 18 October, in Querini Stampalia, during the 2014 International Venice Architecture Biennale.
The other will be held in Glasgow next spring.
