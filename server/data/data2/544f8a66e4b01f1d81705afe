THE Scottish athletics star was one of the heroes of the Glasgow 2014 Games and reflects on a memorable past 12 months in a video interview. Video: Commonwealth hero Eilidh Child on her wonder year - Daily Record 
IT has been a year to remember for Eilidh Child with her stunning silver win for Scotland at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games one of several triumphs.
The European 400m Hurdles champion was short-listed for the European Athlete of the year award - the only British female on the list of 12 - and of course also won silver before a capacity crowd at Hampden at the Games in Glasgow.
Her 2014 season also included a British title win in Birmingham and a second place overall on the Diamond League.
Reflecting on the highlights in a video interview, Eilidh also talks about the pressures of being home favourite at the Commonwealth Games and outright event favourite at the European Champs in Zurich in August.
‘I was at the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow seven years ago when it was announced as winning the bid to stage the Commonwealth Games so it was a long countdown!’ she said.
‘I did feel a huge sense of relief after winning the gold in Zurich because I was favourite for the event at the Europeans. I’ve been working with a sports psychologist since London 2012 and that helped me focus in the right way.
‘I kept saying ‘I can only do my best’ but in the end that is what happened – I came off the track at Hampden and in Zurich satisfied that I’d done my best.’
