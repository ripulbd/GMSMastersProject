Crews still at scene of Glasgow fire Emergency crews are continuing to tackle a fire which spread rapidly through a large building near the M74 in Glasgow on Monday night.
Dozens of firefighters were called to the blaze, which broke out shortly before 17:00 at Jessie Street, off Polmadie Road. 
Crews managed to prevent the flames spreading to adjacent properties.
But operations continued through the night and about 15 firefighters are still at the scene.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) asked the members of the public near the incident to keep windows and doors closed as the building material involved in the fire may contain asbestos. 
Tests were being carried out to confirm if asbestos is present.
A number of local road closures remain in place, with diversions being signposted. 
Police and ambulance crews were also at the scene, but there were no reports of casualties and no one was thought to have been in the building at the time.
The SFRS said firefighters from Polmadie community fire station arrived at the scene within minutes of calls being received from members of the public.
They were faced with a &quot;rapidly spreading fire within a large building&quot; measuring around 150m x 100m, and immediately called for further assistance.
Crews used large bore firefighting hoses and two high reach appliances to tackle the flames.
Polmadie Road was closed and motorists were warned of significant traffic disruption in the area. 
The SFRS spokesman said: &quot;We have no information at this time to suggest there is anyone in the building.&quot;
At about 06:30 on Tuesday the fire was still burning with smoke affecting the area around the building.
