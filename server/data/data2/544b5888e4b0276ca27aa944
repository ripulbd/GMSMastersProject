WE'VE taken MTV's image of the glamour icon enjoying a light continental breakfast on a sun-kissed balcony and turned it into waking up in a scheme the morning after the televised awards. Daily Record give Nicki Minaj and MTV a reality check with out own version of life in the big city - Daily Record MEET the new Pop Queen of Scotland – as you’ve never seen her before.
Nicki Minaj is a renowned glamour icon but when she comes to Glasgow, she’ll find it has a style all its own.
The Anaconda rapper, 31, is flying in next week to host the biggest music event of the year at the SSE Hydro – the MTV Europe Music Awards.
 

Yesterday, she released an optimistic preview image of the kind of stay she expects in Scotland’s biggest city.
The picture shows Nicki dressed in lace, reading a fictional local paper and enjoying a sophisticated continental breakfast on a sun-kissed balcony.
Aye, right – if she really wants to get into the Glasgow spirit, she’d be better going for a look that’s less glitzy dream and more housing scheme.

Our artists updated the publicity photo to give her a more Scottish look and help her blend in when she hits Clydeside. The sunny terrace is replaced by a bedsit warmed by a gas fire and the croissants and fruit juice have been binned in favour of a roll ’n’ square, a can of Bru and an overflowing ashtray.
A nice comfy hoodie beats a flimsy shawl any day.
And, if Nicki really wants to fit in here, there’s only one paper she should read at breakfast time – your Daily Record.
