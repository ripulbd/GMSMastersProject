RANGERS fans' chief Drew Roberton is convinced Dave King is the right man to stave off another financial collapse at Ibrox. King is only man who can save club, says fans' chief RANGERS fans' chief Drew Roberton is convinced Dave King is the right man to stave off another financial collapse at Ibrox.He also hit out at billionaire Newcastle United tycoon Mike Ashley's plans to remove chief executive Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of Rangers.As reported in later editions of yesterday's Evening Times, Ashley has called for an extraordinary general meeting in a bid to oust the pair.The Sports Direct boss is understood to be ready to bid to increase his 8.92% stake in the Ibrox club to 25%.Rangers Supporters Association chief Roberton said: &quot;It's shocking that a chief executive can be sacked for doing his job - bringing in funds to the club.&quot;Mike Ashley sees Rangers as a vehicle to push his Sports Direct brand, he's more interested in himself than in Rangers.&quot;Dave King appears to be the only show in town that has money to invest and Rangers at heart. I have no doubt Dave King would put Rangers' interests ahead of his own.&quot;South African-based Scots tycoon King has been in talks with Wallace, discussing plans for an urgently needed cash injection.The proposed rescue package could finally allow the club to move forward after almost three years of civil war.Roberton added: &quot;When Craig Mather met Dave King, he left the club shortly after.&quot;Now, Wallace has met with Dave King and he is facing unemployment.&quot;Mike Ashley needs to answer why he is determined to stop money coming in, what exactly is his business plan?&quot;Ibrox shareholder Ashley, who upped his stake in the club almost a week ago, made a move to shake up the boardroom amid rumours he is plotting a push for more control.He increased his stake through his company MASH Holdings Ltd and now holds 5% of voting rights.However, Ibrox fans criticised him for strengthening his power base without ploughing the &pound;850,000 spent on shares into the crisis-hit club.Roberton said: &quot;Why did Ashley not put money into Rangers when it was needed, during the share offer?&quot;A statement on the London Stock Exchange read: &quot;MASH requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company.&quot;The notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of the company.&quot;If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting, particularly given the company's forthcoming Annual General Meeting.&quot;Chris Graham, of the Union of Fans, said: &quot;If you are stupid enough to believe Easdale or Ashley care about Rangers, or the fans, then you'll end up with the club you deserve.&quot;Sandy Easdale, owner of McGill's Buses, has influence over 26% of the shareholding at Ibrox.His spokesman, Jack Irvine, said: &quot;Sandy Easdale is not part of the PLC board and has no knowledge of any of the recent announcements.&quot;However he is watching with interest.&quot;Ashley needs a majority, and possibly backing from Easdale and Laxey Partners - the club's main shareholder - to remove Wallace and Nash.But, the current Rangers board hit back and said they will fight to save the pair's positions.Rangers' statement continued: &quot;The board is united in its support of the executive team.&quot;If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.&quot;In a statement last night, Paul Murray and George Letham said: &quot;We are in discussions with the board regarding a proposal to provide the club with a funding package to be provided by like minded individuals, including Dave King.&quot;The discussions should remain private and confidential and we will provide more details in due course.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
