Village anger at greenbelt housing bid HUNDREDS OF people have signed a petition against a large-scale housing development on greenbelt land.More than 450 residents in Waterfoot, East Renfrewshire, have signed the petition.Gladman Developments, is seeking in principle planning approval from East Renfrewshire Council to build up to 100 new houses.But the proposals have met with strong opposition from locals, who believe the development will destroy the character of the village and put local roads, schools and medical services under serious pressure.The plans also run contrary to East Renfrewshire's Local Development Plan, which designates the land as greenbelt that must be protected.Delivering the petition to the council's offices, John McCourt, spokesman for community pressure group Waterfoot Action, said: &quot;Our petition clearly shows the strength of local opposition to this ill-conceived development.&quot;We've knocked on doors throughout Waterfoot and collected more than 450 signatures from people who are extremely concerned about the threat these plans pose to our community and the greenbelt.&quot;According to East Renfrewshire's planning website, more than 90 objections have already been lodged with the council and Waterfoot Action is urging everyone who has not yet objected to make their voice heard.Mr McCourt added: &quot;It's crucial that people in Waterfoot and surrounding areas submit their comments.&quot;Public consultation is crucial to the planning process and this our best chance to raise our concerns and stop this unwanted development from going ahead.&quot;It's also very important to do this now, because only those who have objected will be allowed to make further comments if the plans go to appeal.&quot;
