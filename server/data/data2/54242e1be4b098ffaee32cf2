UKIP donor calls for English indyref to eject Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from UK A Ukip donor has called for an English referendum on ejecting Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.Property investor Andrew Perloff, chairman of Hertfordshire-based real estate firm Panther Securities, said Scotland's rejection of independence came as no surprise given that UK taxpayers &quot;contribute &pound;1,600 per year per person... to these malcontents&quot;.Under the heading &quot;chairman's ramblings&quot; in Panther Securities' interim results, Mr Perloff said: &quot;We have just had the result of the Scottish referendum which appears as a resounding Yes to the union 55% in favour to 45% against.&quot;I do not know why the result would have been in doubt.&quot;Why would any faction of a social club resign when all the other members contribute &pound;1,600 per year per person to their particular faction and have been further browbeaten to offer further incentives to these malcontents?&quot;Perhaps now the English can have a referendum as to whether we wish to keep the Scots in and whilst we are at it, the Irish and Welsh as well! Why should the Scots have a one-way bet?&quot;Panther Securities, which recorded pre-tax profits of &pound;3,235,000 in the six months to June, has donated &pound;17,500 to Ukip.The interim report states: &quot;At our Annual General Meeting held on 18 June 2014, the resolution I submitted to donate &pound;17,500 to the UK Independence Party was hotly debated. The voting went to a poll resulting in the resolution being passed.&quot;Meanwhile, financial giant JP Morgan has reported that the &quot;political uncertainties&quot; surrounding the independence referendum have receded following the No vote, but that further uncertainties remain.The final results for JPMorgan Mid Cap Investment Trust state: &quot;While political uncertainties will increase ahead of the general election next May, the clear majority in the Scottish referendum in favour of maintaining the Union removed a significant uncertainty for investors.&quot;However, the ultimate political and economic consequences for all members of the UK may take some time to emerge.&quot;
