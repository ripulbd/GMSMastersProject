The Ultimo founder appeared on Good Morning Britain yesterday and voiced her concerns over the severity of the abuse she received.
She said: “I’ve got over it now, but it was really severe. When you block someone on Twitter you can send a report, but I never heard back from Twitter once, so that’s what worries me especially when it comes to children. When kids get bullied at school in the playground people say things in the heat of the moment.
“But when someone’s sitting behind a keyboard it’s like a hundred times worse because they just attack in a very severe way.”
