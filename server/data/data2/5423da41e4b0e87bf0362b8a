VISITORS to a Lanarkshire museum will be given a insight into the life of a First World War soldier. Step back in time to the Great War at Summerlee VISITORS to a Lanarkshire museum will be given a insight into the life of a First World War soldier.Re-enactment group 'Gordon Highlanders 1914-1918' are bringing their authentic campsite and a wide range of activities and displays to Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life in Coatbridge.Over this weekend's September holiday they will be on parade both days with their troop of volunteers, who will act out twice-daily displays, drills and show examples of a soldier's physical training.The group will also interact with visitors and display weapons, kit and medical equipment from the era at the campsite.There will also be a miniature obstacle course with imitation barbed wire for children to crawl through, and uniforms to try on.The Gordon Highlanders existed from 1881 until 1994 and took their name from the Clan Gordon.They recruited mainly from the North-East of Scotland and soldiers stood out from the rest of the British Army thanks to their kilts and Highland regalia.During the First World War, where they lost 29,000 men, 21 battalions of Gordons served on the Western Front and in Italy.In 2006 the Gordons were merged with other regiments to become The Royal Regiment of Scotland.Group organiser for the Gordon Highlanders 1914-1918, Tom Greenshields, said: &quot;We are looking forward to our weekend at Summerlee, with its strong sense of history and family connections to the men who fought in the First World War.&quot;At our campsite, we will engage with visitors about our life in the trenches, our weapons, kit and the medical resources available to the men at the front. For family historians, we can advise on regimental history and archives and help with queries about relatives who may have fought in the trenches or other aspects of the war.&quot;Summerlee has a rich history of hosting educational and fun-packed shows and the museum's bosses are thrilled to be welcoming the Gordon Highlanders 1914-1918.Summerlee's Laura Eales said: &quot;This promises to be a most fascinating weekend, which forms part of the North Lanarkshire contribution to the UK-wide 'Peoples War' project.&quot;This Heritage Lottery Fund supported project aims to gather previously unrecorded family war histories, stories and memorabilia for local archives.&quot;The museum will hold drop-in sessions on the Sunday for visitors to talk about family stories from the First World War.It is hoped that they will then be used in future exhibitions and events.Staff will also offer advice on the storage and preservation of photographs, letters and artefacts.Laura continued: &quot;Our Edwardian tram, which will be in operation, is of the period, and many young men from the Monklands will have ridden on one on their last days at home, before setting off for France.&quot;Other activities will take place around the site, including a display of Austin Seven cars, the B Flat Miners and Gaelic choirs, plus children's crafts.&quot;It'll be a great weekend for all ages and interests.&quot;Gates are open from 10am to 5pm on Saturday September 27 and Sunday September 28 and admission is free.There will be a small charge for tram rides and some craft activities.
