GLASGOW schoolgirl - who has got through to judges' houses stage - burst into tears when parents surprised her with new pet. Present of pooch means double delight for X Factor hopeful Emily Middlemas as she goes through to next round - Daily Record A SCOTS X Factor contestant had a 16th birthday to remember yesterday when she reached the next round … and got a puppy.
Emily Middlemas, of Glasgow, was already excitedly looking forward to watching last night’s pre-recorded episode of the ITV talent show – in which she got through to the judges’ houses stage – when her parents surprised her with an adorable new pet.
The Woodfarm High pupil said: “My brother took me out for lunch and when I came back there was this wee box in the living room. The minute I opened it, I started crying.
“My family have a Yorkie and a Jack Russell but I always wanted a wee dog for myself and he’s gorgeous.
“I don’t have a name for him yet but I might ask some of my new followers on Twitter.”
The puppy was the icing on the cake on a day when friends joined Emily at her parents’ house to see her survive the tough boot camp stage.
 

She said performing at London’s Wembley Arena to win her seat as one of the last six girls remaining on the show was an amazing experience.
Emily sang Ellie Goulding’s Anything Could Happen – and couldn’t believe it when judge Simon Cowell joined in.
She said: “I wish I could replay the moment over and over again.”
 

But while Emily had a perfect day, Joe Slater, who is originally from Liverpool but lives in Glasgow, failed to impress boys’ mentor Mel B.
The 18-year-old actor’s version of Eagles hit Desperado left the Spice Girl feeling desperate for him to get off stage.
She told fellow judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini: “I wish I could stop this.”
