CHILDREN were put at risk after being treated by a woman who was not qualified as a nurse. Unqualified 'nurse' put 'kids in her care at risk' CHILDREN were put at risk after being treated by a woman who was not qualified as a nurse.Kathryn Ritchie worked at the Bank Street Clinic, in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, and Clydebank Health Centre for more than four years without a nursing qualification.Health visitors raised the alarm, telling bosses they had &quot;serious concerns&quot; about her ability to perform child immunisations safely at the Clydebank centre.When Mrs Ritchie, 54, a registered midwife, was approached about her nursing skills she went off sick for eight months.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said today it had taken steps to ensure the mistake &quot;does not occur again&quot; after Mrs Ritchie was struck off the register after admitting the charges.The Nursing and Midwifery Council said it was &quot;fortuitous&quot; that no harm had come to any children under her care.Mrs Ritchie, 54, fradulently enrolled on a postgraduate course in public health nursing at the University of the West of Scotland where there is a requirement to hold a nursing qualification.She also falsely claimed to have completed 450 hours practice as a midwife in order to retain her registration. She resigned from her post with NHSGGC on January 23, 2012.And following a referral to the Nursing and Midwifery Council on February 26, 2012, it was discovered Mrs Ritchie has never been registered as a nurse, only as a midwife.Mrs Ritchie worked at the Bank Street Clinic from &shy;October 2007 before being transferred to Clydebank Health Centre in early 2010.She was later moved to an occupational health post but her work continued to fall &quot;below the acceptable standard expected of a nurse&quot;.NMC hearing papers state: &quot;Mrs Ritchie had undertaken the duties of a registered nurse when she was not qualified to do so, and when she knew this to be the case.&quot;These duties had included the immunisation of children and the panel bore in mind the risk Mrs Ritchie caused to those children by practising without the required training and qualifications.&quot;It was purely fortuitous that no actual harm was caused to these patients.&quot;A statement from NHSGGC said: &quot;Since this case occurred we have taken steps to ensure that learnings have been taken forward to ensure this type of situation does not occur again.&quot;All managers who have responsibility for recruitment have been given training on our recruitment procedures which includes ensuring that nursing qualifications and registration are checked.&quot;
