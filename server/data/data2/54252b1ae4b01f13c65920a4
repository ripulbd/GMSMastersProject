Clock ticking for watch heist gang A GANG of axe-wielding thieves may not be able to flog their £250,000 haul of loot because it's "too hot", police said today.The four balaclava-clad robbers made off with a haul of designer watches after raiding jewellers in the Glasgow's Argyll Arcade.But the gang - who remain at large following the brazen daylight heist - will struggle to sell on the high-end timepieces.It is understood some of the stolen watches are worth around &pound;30,000 each and, unless they were stolen to &shy;order, the thieves will have trouble offloading them any time soon.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland said a team of officers were working to trace the culprits.As reported by the Evening Times, shoppers fled in terror as the armed thugs - dressed in tracksuits and balaclavas - used sledgehammers and axes to smash shop windows in the Arcade.They held up Rox, Mappin and Webb, &shy;Laing the Jeweller and Lewis Grant - at around 1pm on Wednesday - &shy;before escaping in a getaway car.Rox was the only store to have items, including Hublot and Bell &amp; Ross watches, stolen.Bosses at Rox have now hired a security guard to give staff &quot;extra piece of mind&quot;.Mr Sutherland said: &quot;I would encourage anyone who knows anything about the incident to contact police.&quot;rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk
