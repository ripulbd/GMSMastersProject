IT'S the second time in four months that the disused building on Broomloan Road in Glasgow has gone up in flames. Watch the video here. Video: Firefighters tackle SECOND major blaze at Sir Alex Ferguson's old primary school in Govan - Daily Record FIREFIGHTERS battled a massive blaze at a derelict school last night.
Five crews were sent to the old Broomloan Road School in Govan, Glasgow,after a fire broke out at around 11pm.
Firefighters were still on the scene in the early hours of this morning. Half of the school burnt down in May.
  &nbsp;
The former Manchester United boss, Sir Alex Ferguson, attended the school from 1946 until 1954.
Sir Alex recently spoke about his time at the school in an educational supplement.
He revealed that he still keeps the belt he was beaten with by his favourite teacher at the school, Elizabeth Thomson, who inspired him to greatness.
 

&quot;It's in my study,&quot; he said. &quot;My grandchildren are terrified of it. Six from that belt and you were in absolute agony. I used to try to draw my hand away.&quot;
Despite the punishments he kept in touch with Ms Thomson throughout his career.

&quot;When she first got to Broomloan Road Primary, she went round to the house of every student who wasn't in her class that day and said, 'If your kid isn't in school tomorrow, I'll be back at your door'.
&quot;Maybe 2,000 teachers turned the job down, turned down that sort of challenge, but she thrived on it. She improved everyone she touched. She actively sought out challenge.&quot;
