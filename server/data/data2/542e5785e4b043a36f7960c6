RAUNCHY footwear - on sale in Edinburgh yesterday - sparks furious reaction from parents and MSP. Shoe chain under fire for selling boots with design showing couple having sex - Daily Record A SHOE chain came under fire yesterday for selling boots with a design showing a couple having sex.
The &pound;175 trainers from Spanish brand Camper, who have shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow, sparked a furious reaction from parents and an MSP.
The Himalayan ankle boots by German designer Bernhard Willhelm are available from a size two – small enough for a child.
They were on sale in store in Edinburgh and online yesterday and are described as combining the designer’s “love of provocation” with Camper’s “free-spirited attitude”.
One 39-year-old mum, from Perthshire, who asked not to be named, said: “The pictures are exceptionally graphic.
“I’d worry I’d be arrested for wearing them but imagine if someone leaves them lying around and a child sees them.”
Tory MSP Liz Smith added: “I do not consider this an appropriate marketing tool if the shoes are likely to be sold to young people. I think there will be lots of parents concerned about the message this sends out.”
Camper UK’s Ruth Coughlan said: “The Himalayan shoe is a niche collection and includes the designer’s artistic expression. They are available for adults only.”
