One-eyed cat found limping in the west end The Scottish SPCA is seeking the owner of a one-eyed cat found limping in the West End of Glasgow.Scotland's animal welfare charity was called to rescue the neutered male tabby and white cat on Saturday, October 25 from Kestrel Road.The cat is now in the care of the charity's Glasgow Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in Cardonald, where he has been nicknamed Jack.Inspector Laura McIntyre said: &quot;Jack is certainly a distinctive cat as he only has one eye.&quot;He also has an unusual black mark on his nose so we're sure someone must recognise him.&quot;Jack's left eye has been surgically removed at some point but this doesn't appear to cause him any issues.&quot;He also has an abscess on his paw, causing him to limp, but is now receiving vet treatment for this.&quot;We think someone may be worried about Jack and we'd love to return him home if this is the case.&quot;It's a shame he isn't microchipped as we could easily have notified his owner already.&quot;Hopefully someone will come forward following our appeal. If no-one does, we'll find him a loving new home.&quot;Anyone who recognises Jack is being urged to contact the Scottish SPCA's Glasgow centre on 03000 999 999.
