Scots zookeeper who was mauled to death by a tiger would not have wanted the animal destroyed, says mum - Daily Record A ZOOKEEPER who was mauled to death by a tiger would not have wanted the animal destroyed, her mum said yesterday.
Sarah McClay’s mum Fiona said her daughter was killed doing her “dream job”.
When asked about calls for the tiger to be put down after the tragedy, Fiona added: “That is absolutely 100 per cent not what Sarah would have wanted.
“She would not have blamed the tiger for what happened.”
 

Fiona, of Linlithgow, West Lothian, was giving evidence at an inquest into 24-year-old Sarah’s death at the South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, in May last year.
Sarah, originally from Glasgow, was going about her routine duties in the big cat enclosure when she was confronted by male Sumatran tiger Padang.
She was gored on her neck, back, arms and foot. Her spine was crushed, her ribs were broken and she was bruised on her head and back when the animal dragged her along the ground.
 

Sarah was airlifted to hospital, where she died that day.
The inquest in Kendal, Cumbria, heard that a safety inspection carried out a few hours after the tragedy found a defective bolt on a gate in the tiger house which kept the big animals separate from keepers.
Fiona told the inquest: “Sarah was an animal carer at the park for three years. She talked about it constantly. It was her dream job, ever since she had visited there as a young child.”
The inquest continues today.
