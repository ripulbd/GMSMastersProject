Court rejects appeal from dead killer A PENSIONER who died in jail after serving 37 years for murdering a female bakery worker has lost an appeal against his conviction.Lawyers acting for Thomas Young, 79, were given permission to continue arguing that their client should have his murder conviction quashed after he died in July.Young was jailed for life in October 1977 for killing Frances Barker, of Maryhill, in a remote rural road in Glenboig, Lanarkshire, in June that year.However, Young's legal team argued that he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission sent the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh.But in a judgement issued by the court on Friday, judges Lord Eassie, Lord Menzies and Lord Bracadale ruled that there was enough evidence to allow the conviction to stand.In the judgement, Lord Eassie wrote: &quot;We therefore consider that this submission on behalf of the appellant must be rejected.&quot;Young, a prisoner of HMP Peterhead, was jailed for life at the High Court in Glasgow in 1977.The court heard he abduc&shy;ted Frances from near her home in June that year.Her strangled body was found woodland in Glenboig, Lanarkshire.Young was also found guilty of two attempted murders, two rapes and other offences but had always protested his innocence.In recent years Young maintained there was enough evidence to lead a court to overturn his murder conviction.The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission sent the case to the appeal court to consider whether Young had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.However, Young died as his appeal was making its way through the legal system.
