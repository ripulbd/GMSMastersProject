MAJOR building schemes worth almost £3billion have been approved by Glasgow planners in the past two years. £3bn building bonanza as city celebrates investment MAJOR building schemes worth almost £3billion have been approved by Glasgow planners in the past two years.City leaders say the scale of development indicates the confidence companies have in the city.Much of the success in attracting large scale projects is down to Invest Glasgow, which is made up of a range of organisations including the council, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.Developments include the &pound;842million New South Glasgow Hospitals Campus, the &pound;228m Riverside and City campuses for City of Glasgow College, the &pound;180m Athletes' Village, the &pound;113m Emirates Arena, the &pound;300m extension to Buchanan Galleries, the &pound;220m regeneration of Sighthill, a &pound;200m housing development at Darnley Mains, the &pound;70m St Vincent Plaza office block, and the new &pound;154m recycling centre at Polmadie.Invest Glasgow was set up to promote the city as one of the most business-friendly locations in the UK and Europe.In 2012/2013 the organisation helped the city attract nearly 1000 new jobs in financial and business services, life sciences, engineering, design and manufacturing and low carbon industries.Liz Cameron, the city council's spokeswoman on jobs and the economy, said: &quot;It used to be said you could tell if a city is growing, developing or coming out of recession by counting the cranes across its skyline.&quot;I am glad to say there are a lot of cranes to count in Glasgow right now.&quot;Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said: &quot;UK national figures suggest that investment is slow, that government at all levels has slashed its capital budgets and that large corporations are holding on to their cash.&quot;But one look at this remarkable level of investment over just two years shows that we are bucking the trend.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
