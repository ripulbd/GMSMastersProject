Gang of fancy dress thugs leave two men in hospital after vicious Glasgow city centre attack - Daily Record A GANG of fancy dress thugs have left two men in hospital in a vicious city centre assault.
Seven men, one wearing a Robin Hood costume and another in a blonde Heidi wig, are being hunted by police after the attack in the early hours of Sunday in Glasgow.
The 31 and 33-year-old victims were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary by ambulance with head injuries after being punched and kicked on Renfield Street at around 3.15am.
The seven suspects - who were later spotted getting into a taxi at Buchanan Street Bus Station - are described as white, Scottish, and in their late 20’s or early 30’s.
One was wearing a green coloured Robin Hood hat with a red feather at the left hand side. Another had on a Heidi type blonde wig with plaits on either side.
Detective Constable David Copeland said: “This was an unprovoked attack on two men by a much larger group which has left the victims with serious injuries.
“This type of activity on what seems to be a night out cannot be tolerated.
“We seek the assistance of the public in tracking down those responsible.
“I am particularly keen to trace the driver of the hackney taxi who picked up five of the suspects – including the suspects in costume – from a taxi rank at Buchanan Street Bus Station at 0346 hours.”
Anyone with information is asked to contact police at Stewart Street on 101. Alternatively Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where information can be passed in confidence.
