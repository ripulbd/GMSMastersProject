KELLY cut off his electronic tag last month – just weeks after being released from Lowmoss Prison, near Glasgow, under licence. Reward of £5000 put on the head of machete thug Johnathan Kelly - Daily Record A REWARD of &pound;5000 has been put on the head of machete thug Johnathan Kelly – the most wanted man in Scotland.
Kelly cut off his electronic tag last month – just weeks after being released from Lowmoss Prison, near Glasgow, under licence.
Now Crimestoppers have raised the award for information leading to his arrest from &pound;1000 to &pound;5000.
 Since going on the run, Kelly, 33, has been linked to a gun attack on a family home. He has a string of convictions, including  paralysing a man with a machete. 
Earlier this month, it is believed he was targeting a gangland rival but shot at the wrong house in an Edinburgh estate, putting

the family in fear of their lives.
His intended target is thought to live a few doors farther along the street.
Kelly, of Drumchapel, Glasgow, was at the centre of an armed siege in the city the previous month.
Police responded to a reported sighting of him in Crosshill and sealed off a street but failed to find him.
Fraudster Robert Kelbie has been told by police he is the target of a hit by Kelly, who is being sheltered by associates of jailed drug baron Mark Richardson.
Kelbie and Richardson are locked in a feud which has seen Kelbie shot and Richardson’s dad battered with baseball bats.
It is believed Kelbie has refused police protection.
The Daily Record has told how Kelly is threatening to shoot police. A pal said: “He’s got a shotgun and, if the police get him, he’s going to take one of them out.”
