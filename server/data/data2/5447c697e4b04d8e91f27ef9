Carmen, the Spanish dog found roaming the streets of Airdrie The Scottish SPCA is seeking the owner of a dog found in Lanarkshire with a Spanish microchip.Police picked up the dog after she was discovered straying on Deedes Street in Airdrie on Friday, October 17.She was then taken to the Scottish SPCA's animal rescue and rehoming centre in Hamilton, where staff discovered she has previously lived in Spain.The female, thought to be an Estrela mountain dog, is around two to three years old and has been nicknamed Carmen by staff.Centre manager Peter Fleming said: &quot;Unfortunately Carmen's microchip hasn't been registered in this country and we've been unable to find any contact details for her owner.&quot;It may be that someone brought Carmen to Scotland when they moved here from Spain and she has gone missing recently.&quot;We also can't rule out the possibility she has come over on holiday with her owner and been left behind.&quot;Hopefully someone will recognise Carmen as we'd really like to return this lovely girl home, wherever that may be. If no-one comes forward we'll find her a loving new owner.&quot;Anyone who recognises Carmen is being asked to call the Scottish SPCA's centre in Hamilton on 03000 999 999.
