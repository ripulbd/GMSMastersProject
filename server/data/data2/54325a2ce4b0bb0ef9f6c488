Call to Sturgeon to rule out second referendum SCOTTISH Secretary Alistair Carmichael has called on Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to rule out a rapid second independence referendum, following last month's No vote.At the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Carmichael said the issue of bringing Scots together after the poll was a &quot;big test&quot; for the SNP leadership and Ms Sturgeon in particular, as the likely successor to Alex Salmond.He told activists: &quot;We settled the independence question in a way that was legal, fair and decisive. And we won. But now the campaign is over and now we need to move the 45% who voted Yes and the 55% who voted No.&quot;People of Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom and that democratic decision must be respected.&quot;So now is the time to use your imagination, and to take action that really will deliver change for Scotland ... change that will benefit all of our United Kingdom.&quot;We can all wave flags, join protests and march if we want to. But wouldn't it be better to set those things aside, to accept the will of the Scottish people and to put your shoulder to the wheel in our common endeavour?&quot;For the SNP leadership - for Nicola Sturgeon - this is of course a big test. It is disappointing that she has declined to rule out pushing for a second referendum in less than three years from now.&quot;There is still time for her to clarify that she will push for no such thing. And I hope she will take that opportunity.&quot;Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: &quot;Britain will never be the same again but I can assure you that the Liberal Democrats will never support a nationalist effort to create an unstable form of devolution as a ticking time bomb deliberately designed to deliver independence.&quot;So there is a test for the SNP - will they be like Gollum in Lord of the Rings, torn apart by the lust for the ring of independence?&quot;Or will they work constructively with others to create Home Rule that is stable, as well as powerful, inside the United Kingdom? That is the real test.&quot;SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said: &quot;The Lib Dems made a vow to deliver extensive new powers to the people of Scotland - it is time for them to honour that.&quot;Alistair Carmichael, Willie Rennie and Danny Alexander should be focusing their efforts on ensuring their Tory chums keep their promises on powers. In the past week we have seen Tory talk of three-year delays and attempts to hold Scotland's powers to ransom over English votes for English laws.&quot;This is not good enough.&quot;
