Rangers supporters want Â­answers over loan FANS reacted in fury and called for the Rangers board to justify the latest move.Chris Graham, Union of Fans spokesman, said: &quot;My first reaction is one of anger that the board had an option to bring in long term investment and they have chosen to go with a short-term loan from Mike Ashley.&quot;It beggars belief. I wish I could say I was surprised at what goes on round that boardroom table but I'm not anymore.&quot;The board had a decision to make. It is quite clear that Ashley has come in at the last minute. They are going to have to justify their decision at some point.&quot;They have effectively been bullied by Mike Ashley, but at the end of the day it's indefensible.&quot;Drew Roberton, general secretary of the Rangers Supporters Association, added: &quot;It is not difficult to understand why people have serious reservations.&quot;It is easy to see why people are concerned about the prospect of Murray Park being sold and Ibrox being sold and leased back.&quot;How else are the club going to raise the necessary finance? The &pound;2million is not going to last long. And it has to be paid back in six months.&quot;I am sure there is a grand plan. But what is it?&quot;
