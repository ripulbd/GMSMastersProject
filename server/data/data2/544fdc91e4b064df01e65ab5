A man who attacked a stranger and left him dying in a Glasgow street is facing a life sentence for murder. Luke Quinn convicted of murdering Simon Richardson in Glasgow A man who attacked a stranger and left him dying in a Glasgow street is facing a life sentence for murder.
Luke Quinn, 33, from Busby, East Renfrewshire, knocked Simon Richardson to the ground and stamped on him in Wellington Street, on 8 December 2013. 
The 45-year-old, from Paisley in Renfrewshire, later died in hospital.
Quinn claimed diminished responsibility due to Aspergers Syndrome but a jury convicted him of murder. Sentence was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow .
The court heard Mr Richardson, who was the main carer for his mother, had earlier been on a night out with friends in Glasgow before the attack. 
He was looking for a taxi when he encountered Quinn in Wellington Street. 
CCTV images showed the two men chatting before Quinn suddenly lashed out with a punch.
Mr Richardson fell to the ground and Quinn could be seen stamping on him and rifling his pockets before stamping on him again and punching him. 
The victim later died in the city's Royal Infirmary from internal bleeding caused by a blow to the abdomen.
When Quinn was detained and charged with murder he became upset and agitated and told police: &quot;Why is God doing this to me?&quot;
Quinn did not give evidence during his trial but he told a psychologist that he snapped because he did not like being touched and Mr Richardson had been patting him on the back when he spoke to him. 
The court heard that Mr Richardson's mother died six weeks after him on Christmas Day in 2013.
Temporary judge Bill Dunlop QC deferred sentence on Quinn, who originally comes from South Africa, until next month for background reports. 
He will receive a mandatory life term and be told how long he must serve until he can apply for parole.
