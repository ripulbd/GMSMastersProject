ORGANISERS of local foodbanks are coming together to help improve the lives of people in poverty. Forum bids to improve links for foodbanks ORGANISERS of local foodbanks are coming together to help improve the lives of people in poverty.Glasgow City Council's Food Bank Forum is trying to strengthen the links between the different charities and volunteers who provide meals and support to the most needy.The forum was set-up last year to try to get an accurate picture of the number of foodbanks in Glasgow. There is thought to be more than 50, with the number increasing because of growing need.But now the council has stepped up action to help provide more support after the Even-ing Times highlighted the plight of people living in poverty, and how much work volun-teers do for them.Our Food for Thought campaign was launched in May, when we demanded a more co-ordinated approach to foodbanks and to remove the stigma attached to them so no one is in doubt about where to get help.Julie Webster, co-ordinator of Greater Maryhill Foodbank and Balornock Action Against Hunger, said working together was the best way forward.She said: &quot;I work with other foodbanks across the city because Glasgow is in all this together.&quot;We should be working in a partnership. If someone walks from Shettleston to Maryhill for food, of course we'll give them it.&quot;But I'll also tell them there's a foodbank nearer them and call Glasgow North East Foodbank and set it up for them, so they don't have to walk all that way again.&quot;A spokesman from the council said they were &quot;keen to create links&quot; between the foodbanks and other agencies.He said the forum &quot;represents a chance for the foodbanks to share examples of best practice and learn from one another about how to best avoid pitfalls they may have encountered&quot;.Presentations have been given by benefits staff, NHS workers and representatives from the Poverty Truth Comm-ission at forum meetings.Health workers told volunteers about nutri-tion and which foods can provide the greatest benefit. There is also a plan for a central stock and distribution system to help with product shortages or surpluses.rachel.loxton@ eveningtimes.co.uk
