FIRE bosses have hit out at wreckless vandals who deliberately torched two derelict Glasgow schools. Fire chief's anger at blazes at two schools FIRE bosses have hit out at wreckless vandals who deliberately torched two derelict Glasgow schools.A senior officer said that the blazes in Drumoyne Primary School yesterday morning and Govan's Broamloan Road Primary School on Tuesday could have had &quot;horrendous&quot; consequences.Group Manager Iain Goodlet, the fire service's head of protection for Glasgow, said those who start blazes must also consider the drain on resources and that life saving assistance is being diverted away from those who really need it.Mr Goodlet said: &quot;We have seen two incidents in two nights that have taken up significant fire and rescue resources.&quot;The crews and appliances required to tackle needless fires are unavailable to respond to house fires, road traffic collisions or any other emergency that happen during that time.&quot;Anyone responsible for setting fires needs to know there could be truly horrendous consequences and they need to consider whether they could live with themselves if someone was killed.&quot;Investigations were launched following the blazes, and both are being treated by police as suspicious.As reported in late editions of the Evening Times, Drumoyne Primary School on Sheildhall Road was badly damaged by a blaze which took hold at around 2am on yesterday.Eight fire appliances rushed to the scene and the blaze was said to be &quot;well alight&quot; when crews arrived.At its peak 40 firefighters battled to control the flames at the school.It came after another suspicious blaze at Broamloan Road Primary - Sir Alex Ferguson's former school - in Govan on Tuesday.Crews were forced to battle the blaze from the street after asbestos was found in the building.Also on Tuesday, an electrical fire broke out in the roof space of St Bartholomew's Primary and Machrie Nursery, in Castlemilk. The school, which was used as a pollling station, suffered minor damage.Investigations to establish the circumstances of the suspicious fires are ongoing.Mr Goodlet added: &quot;We work incredibly closely with our colleagues from the police to investigate fires and see that anyone setting them is identified and held to account for their reckless, criminal actions.&quot;Anyone with information should contact police on 101.
