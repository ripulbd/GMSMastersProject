Roza Salih, has helped to obtain scholarship funding for three places. 
She was one of seven Glasgow schoolgirls who campaigned against dawn raids by immigration officials in Drumchapel in 2005.
Their story has subsequently been made into a musical and film.
Ms Salih, whose family came to Glasgow from Iraqi Kurdistan, is now Vice President Diversity &amp; Advocacy of the University of Strathclyde Students' Association (USSA), 
She said: &quot;I'm absolutely thrilled that the University of Strathclyde has agreed to help three asylum seekers to access higher education. 
&quot;This will create life-changing opportunities for those whose talents might otherwise have been wasted.
&quot;It is, however, unfortunate that we have to take such measures, when the real cause of the problem is an immigration policy which effectively obstructs asylum seekers from higher education and this is an issue I will continue to campaign on.&quot;
USSA said it was very difficult for asylum seekers to study in Scotland due to prohibitive fees and the fact many are not allowed to work.
The scholarship funding was secured with the help of the Scottish Refugee Council.
Elodie Mignard, Integration Development Officer at the council, added: &quot;When people come to Scotland seeking safety and protection from persecution they bring a wealth of skills, talent and experience with them. 
&quot;We welcome the University's proactive stance in supporting asylum seekers to develop these skills further.&quot;
