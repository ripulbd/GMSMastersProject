Footie course helps former soldiers to beat addictions FOR eight years Andrew Hughes served as a tank operator with the King's Royal Hussars in war zones including Kosovo.By the time he left the forces to return to Southampton, he was already drinking heavily.Alcohol eventually took over his life and the war hero admits he turned to booze the minute he woke up and drank steadily until he passed out.Andrew lost his friends and family and ended up in hospital suffering from chronic pancreatitis, weighing just five stone.Two years ago he travelled to Glasgow to stay with a relative but again found himself homeless and drinking heavily.Eventually, Andrew discovered the city council charity Helping Heroes and got the support to turn his life around.He has not had a drink for a year, has completed a pre-entry nursing course and been accepted by Caledonian University to study nursing.But before he starts his studies, the 33-year-old has signed up for a course at Ibrox Stadium to help veterans better understand and beat their addictions.The 16-week project at the Rangers Study Support Centre helps veterans recognise the impact drugs and alcohol has on them, their families and friends.Part of the course involves 30 minutes of fitness training and one hour of coaching with a Rangers community coach, with veterans working towards an SFA coaching certificate.Andrew described his life after the Army as &quot;extremely difficult&quot;.He said: &quot;I was a heavy drinker and alcohol dependent for some time but there was nothing in Southampton support wise.&quot;I landed up in hospital but kept on drinking and landed up losing friends and family and became homeless.&quot;My family are originally from Glasgow and when I moved here I found Helping Heroes.&quot;Through their under-standing and encourage-ment I was shown what was available to me, came off alcohol and because of their continuing support I have been to college and have a place at university.&quot;Andrew, who has made Glasgow his home, is full of praise for the Ibrox course where he can meet fellow veterans, share experiences and have a laugh.Gary Gibson, community coach at Rangers, said: &quot;Rangers are delighted to host the Glasgow Veterans United programme.&quot;The participants are only a few weeks into a 16 week programme and already we have seen a difference in their confidence and self esteem.&quot;City councillor John Kane said: &quot;The course aims to work with the veterans to help them look at their lifestyle, allowing them to give back to their communities.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@eveningtimes.co.uk
