Patrick, 11, goes from Lands End to John O'Groats for Yorkhill CHARITY cyclist Patrick Kiehlmann stopped off at Yorkhill as part of a trip from Lands End to John O'Groats - a journey all the more remarkable because Patrick is just 11.The youngster yesterday called in to the Glasgow hospital for a well-earned pit stop during the 1,011mile trek.He set off on October 9 and hopes to finish the cycle on Sunday after just 11 days to raise money for the Yorkhill Children's Charity.Patrick has raised more than &pound;1200 on his JustGiving page thanks to generous web donations.He and his dad Mark stopped for a breather at the hospital, where Patrick also received a Yorkhill Medal for his efforts.He said: &quot;The charity means a lot to me. I'm pleased to do them a favour after being treated there.&quot;Patrick, from Bishopbriggs, was admitted to the hospital just two years ago with appendicitis.What should have been a routine operation soon turned life threatening.After seven days of recovery he had to be taken back to hospital when his condition deteriorated rapidly overnight.His father, Mark, is cycling alongside his son.Mark said: &quot;We were stunned that it was so serious.&quot;Patrick had a constricted bowel and was back in the operating theatre that night.Mark attributed his son's recovery to the staff who were &quot;excellent and dedicated&quot; and within a week Patrick was recovering well.He said: &quot;After the shock of going into hospital, I just wanted to have fun on my bike again.&quot;Patrick has always been a keen cyclist.When he was five he completed the Pedal for Scotland challenge and cycled from Glasgow to Edinburgh, covering the 50 miles in around five hours. At 10 he did a Sportive, a long distance cycling challenge, and managed to cycle a whopping 110 miles in fewer than 10 hours.Patrick added: &quot;Last year's Sportive was a huge achievement, but I felt I could do even more and this time raise money for Yorkhill Children's Charity.&quot;The idea came to him last October when he was down visiting Lands End with family.Kirsten Sinclair, head of fundraising at Yorkhill Children's Charity, said: &quot;It's absolutely incredible, it's such a mammoth challenge for anyone to complete let alone an 11-year-old.&quot;Seeing kids help other kids is really incredible.&quot;She said the money Patrick was raising would be spent on anything from world class medical equipment to toys for the children to play with on the wards.
