Steel-cutting marks start of Â£348m BAE ships deal THE buzz of a plasma steel-cutting machine signalled the start of work on three offshore patrol vessels which will be built on the Clyde for the Royal Navy.The bumper contract, worth &pound;348 million, will help protect thousands of jobs at the BAE Systems shipyards at Scotstoun and Govan.The construction programme officially got underway when Bernard Gray, Chief of Defence Materiel at the Ministry of Defence switched on the state-of-the-art machine, which cuts sheet steel underwater.Speaking after the ceremony at Govan he said: &quot;I am proud to be able to start production work on this new class of ships, which will maintain the vital UK expertise needed to build the warships of the future.&quot;This contract, which will benefit the local economy in Glasgow, continues a 200-year tradition of building the nation's leading ships on the Clyde.&quot;Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael joined VIPs at the yard yesterday and added: &quot;Scotland is leading the way in building the UK's warships and this underlines the UK Government's commitment to the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde.&quot;Mick Ord, managing director of BAE's naval ships division, said: &quot;Today marks a significant day for our business and the UK shipbuilding industry as we begin construction on a new class of warship for the Royal Navy.&quot;The first ship is expected to be completed in three years' time with the other two ready just a year later. They will be deployed around the world and duties will include anti-piracy patrols.The contract will help protect jobs on the Clyde,which currently sustains 2700 shipyard workers, as work on a multi-billion aircraft carrier programme winds down.However, BAE chiefs are currently axing up to 800 staff, with the defence giant widely reported to be planning to shut operations at Govan and transfer workers to a new &pound;207m yard to be created across the river at Scotstoun.gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk
