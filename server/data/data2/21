UPDATED plans for the £104million transformation of Glasgow Queen Street station have been published. Queen Street revamp taking shape UPDATED plans for the £104million transformation of Glasgow Queen Street station have been published.Additional bike stands and widened passenger stairs at the station's George Square entrance are among the changes unveiled by Network Rail following a public consultation which ran until May.The station is Scot-land's third busiest and known as the &quot;gateway to the Highlands&quot;.The overhaul, which is scheduled to run from next year until 2019, will replace the current 1970s entrance and the hotel extension above with a huge 500sq m modern glass facade intended to turn the station into a George Square landmark.Its completion will mark the final stage of the Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Prog-ramme (Egip), which has already delivered a &pound;25m new-look Haymarket station in Edinburgh and is rolling out electrific-ation across Central Belt routes to cut the shortest journey times between the cities from 48 minutes to 42 min-utes and boost capacity.Original plans were published in February.As a result of feedback, the main access ramp will now be located in the building rather than outside with access to the lower level platforms at the east side of the station improved by moving the lifts closer to the stairs.A study is also under way to assess other measures which could improve access to the lower level platforms.Plans for a footbridge inside the station have been axed and there are also slight changes to the glass facade and the shape of the roof, which will be flatter at the west side.Artists' impressions reveal what the revamped station will look like inside when the public floorspace is doubled, with changes to ticket gate lines creating more space for passengers on the concourse. Network Rail is also working with consultants to maximise disabled access and facilities including parking, drop-off entrances/exits and toilets.Transport Minister Keith Brown said: &quot;Queen Street is one of Scotland's most impor-tant stations.AND he went on: &quot;This consultation is informing plans which will transform it into a 21st-Century transport hub.&quot;It will be an inviting and enjoyable place for people to begin or end their journey on some of Scotland's busiest rail routes, including the improved Glasgow-Edinburgh via Falkirk line through the EGIP scheme, which will result in 30% more seats and around 20% faster journey times on our flagship route.&quot;As previously reveal-ed, platforms will also be extended and the east side of the building will be redeveloped as part of the adjacent Buchanan Galleries extension.A final consultation phase was launched yesterday and will run until December 22.David Dickson, Network Rail route managing director for Scotland, said: &quot;The proposals unveiled for the second phase of consultation demon-strate that we have listened to, and acted on, what people are telling us they want to see.&quot;The feedback we receive in this second phase will be just as important in shaping a station which better serves passengers, serves Glasgow and creates a landmark development.&quot;
