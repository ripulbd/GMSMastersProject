TOMORROW consultations close on a proposed Bill to change Scotland's transplant laws. Organ bill comes one step closer TOMORROW consultations close on a proposed Bill to change Scotland's transplant laws.We look back on the Evening Times campaign that helped spark political actionTHREE people die in the UK each day waiting for an organ transplant.Three years ago, the Evening Times decided to do something to try to change this dreadful statistic.We launched an ambitious campaign calling on the Scottish Government to switch to an opt-out organ donation system, a simple change which has led to donation rates doubling in other European countries.We knew that 90% of people supported organ donation but, at that time, only around 30% were on the UK donor register.Major charities, including the British Heart Foundation told us that an opt-out system - where everyone is considered a donor but individuals can 'opt out' - was one way to help save more lives.Since it was launched on November 25 2013, our Opt for Life campaign has achieved major successes, putting organ donation back into the political spotlight as well as helping drive up numbers on the organ donor register.Glasgow Labour MSP Anne McTaggart said: &quot;Organ donation had remained a topic rarely openly discussed by families and individuals - the Evening Times campaign has fundamentally changed this.&quot;Our petition for an opt-out system was signed by more than 20,000 people.Our campaign was given a major boost when, following a motion put forward by Glasgow SNP MSP Humza Yousaf, more than half of Scotland's MSPs told us they would be in favour of the change.And in December 2012, Evening Times Editor Tony Carlin and reporter Caroline Wilson made the case for an opt-out system at the Scottish Parliament Petition's Committee.Reporter Caroline was further recognised this year with a Campaigner of the Year award from British Heart Foundation Scotland.However, our biggest achievement so far came when Labour MSP Drew Smith announced plans to lodge a member's Bill calling for the change, a political campaign that has now been taken up by fellow MSP, Anne McTaggart,.The Evening Times is now helping to shape the proposed Organ and Tissue (Scotland) Bill, alongside the British Heart Foundation and the BMA.We will continue to support the Scottish Government's sterling work to drive up transplant rates, which have helped lead to Scotland having the highest donor registration in the UK - 40%.But while less than half of the Scottish population is not on the register, the Evening Times will continue to fight for a change the law.Yvonne Hughes, of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said:&quot;Without the drive by the Evening Times campaign to move Scotland to a system of opt-out for organ donation, smaller charities, like ours, would struggle to be heard on this important proposal, which we fully support.&quot;Marjory Burns, Director at British Heart Foundation Scotland, said: &quot;The Opt For Life campaign has played a vital role in raising awareness of the need to change the law in Scotland, keeping this issue at the forefront of our politicians' minds and encouraging readers to have important conversations with their loved ones.&quot;Now we look forward seeing the campaign achieve its greatest success - the change in our organ don ation law that we so urgently need to save more lives.&quot;
