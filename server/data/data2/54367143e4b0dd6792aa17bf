Clegg rouses LibDems with plea for fairness NICK Clegg has asked voters not to judge his party on its failure to stick to its historic pledge not to increase in university tuition fees.Instead he asked people to consider the achievements of the LibDems in coalition and listed what he thought they were.Making his leader's speech, closing the Liberal Democrat party conference in Glasgow, Mr Clegg said they were the only party offering fairness.He said Labour lurched to the left under Ed Miliband and the Tories to the right in response to Ukip.The LibDems have suffered at the ballot box since the 2010 General Election and their deal with the Tories and face a battle to retain seats next year.While Mr Clegg admitted they had been &quot;tainted&quot; by office, he wanted people to understand what LibDem policies were implemented in the last four years.He said: &quot;How will you judge us? By the one policy we couldn't deliver or by the countless policies we did deliver in Government?&quot;He cited income tax cuts, better pensions, help in schools for disadvantaged children, free childcare, enhanced parental leave and investment in green energy as LibDem achievements in the coalition.He added: &quot;Fairness without a strong economy does not work. A strong economy without fairness doesn't work either.&quot;And, as the last few weeks have now put beyond doubt, there's only one party with the head and the heart, the resolve and the compassion, to deliver both, to deliver opportunity for everyone - and it's us.&quot;He attacked both David Cameron and Ed Miliband and said the Tories &quot;stole&quot; his policy of increasing the income tax threshold to help low paid workers.He said: &quot;Ed Miliband, you might have forgotten what you did to our economy, but we have not. And the British people don't want a Labour government running their country, racking up debts for our children and grandchildren to pay.&quot;David Cameron, you can copy our ideas but you will never imitate our values. And the British people don't want a Conservative government running their country which only looks after its own kind.&quot;Mr Clegg ended his speech by saying: &quot;If the Liberal Democrat voice is marginalised, our country will be meaner, poorer and weaker as a result.&quot;We must make our voice heard.&quot;stewart.paterson@eveningtimes.co.uk
