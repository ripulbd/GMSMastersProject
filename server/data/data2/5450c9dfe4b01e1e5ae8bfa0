Clean-up continues at landslip-hit Rest and Be Thankful on A83 Contractors have removed more than 200 tonnes of landslip debris overnight as efforts continue to re-open the A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll.
The route was closed on Monday after days of heavy rain dislodged rocks and earth from the hillside.
A special fence successfully held back more than 1,000 tonnes of debris, including boulders the size of a car. 
The Old Military Road diversion route was opened on Monday and has been operating successfully overnight.
This adds between 15 and 45 minutes to journey times between Tarbet and Inveraray.
Contractor Bear Scotland said removal of debris from the road restarted at first light.
A specialist 16-metre reach excavator has been brought to the site to help remove material from the slope which has been retained by the debris fence.
It will be work throughout the day with two other large excavators to clear the road.
Bear said that a timescale for completing the clear up should be known later on Wednesday.
