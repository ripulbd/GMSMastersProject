Queen's Park is beautiful, particularly at this time of year as the leaves turn to autumn.&quot;It's a lovely park, despite what happened&quot;The event is planned to be a celebration of Moira's life and to keep the 40-year-old's memory alive.Moira's mother, Bea, who lives in Staffordshire, will speak to the gathered runners.Bea, a host of volunteers and members of the Police Scotland Violence Reduction team have organised the charity run.Detectives who worked on Moira's case will be running, as will scientists who analysed evidence, police officers and footballers from Queen's Park.The run will help raise cash for The Moira Fund, set up by Bea to help people whose relatives have been murdered.Organisers hope to raise &pound;9000 from the event, with &pound;3500 already pledged from local bank Santander, which would help 40 families recovering from the violent death of a loved one.June Hepburn, of the Violence Reduction Unit, said: &quot;We have people coming up from England and down from Arbroath; we are really pleased. The local community has been so supportive too with local retailers, such as a florist offering posies, all asking to be involved.&quot;Moira was abducted just yards from her Queen's Park home in May, 2008, and subjected to a horrific rape and torture. Slovakian Marek Harcar was jailed for life for her murder.catriona.stewart @eveningtimes.co.uk
