Our proactive policing approach to tackling crime includes the preventative message and in particular to those most vulnerable, namely our children and the elderly.&quot;Police Scotland encourage and embrace technology in communication and engagement with all communities and recognise the internet as an intrinsic part of people's lifestyle. We welcome this opportunity to educate and improve awareness amongst all communities to prevent crime and reduce opportunities for criminal exploitation.&quot;
