WHEN Susan Elena discovered she was pregnant she feared she would have to hang up her dancing shoes for months. Hey baby! Do you want to go dancing? WHEN Susan Elena discovered she was pregnant she feared she would have to hang up her dancing shoes for months.But medics advised the 34-year-old, who owns Dance HQ in the East End with her mum, Helen McGarvey, it was safe to perform routines with her growing bump - and there were major health benefits.Susan, who is due to give birth to her first child in December, has devised an antenatal class for expectant mums who want to keep dancing.She believes Bump and Groove, which runs every Monday, is the first class of its kind in Scotland.It is a blend of energising dance routines and exercises designed to prepare women for childbirth and to help them recover after.Susan said: &quot;The question I always get asked is: 'Is it safe'?&quot;When I found out I was pregnant I wasn't sure how much I'd be able to do.&quot;But doctors and midwives always say it's fine to carry on exercise if you're used to it.&quot;If you're not used to doing anything you're advised to seek medical advice before doing a new form of exercise, but you're meant to do that whether you're pregnant or not.&quot;Susan took part in a training course run by US firm Dancing Thru Pregnancy, which specialises in pre and post-natal dancing instruction.After she qualified, Susan realised the routines were all about making small changes.She said: &quot;It's about gentle cardio exercise and modifying moves for people with bumps.&quot;So we don't do sit ups, because you're advised not to lie on your back for too long.&quot;There are exercises we concentrate on to open up your hips and prepare your body for childbirth.&quot;Susan was also inspired by former Pussycat Doll and Got to Dance judge Kimberly Wyatt, who kept up dancing while pregnant.Susan said: &quot;I think people are realising that it is okay to dance while pregnant.&quot;Research shows that gentle exercise can help both the mother and baby.Susan is currently training someone to take over the class when she goes on leave at the end of November.The class runs every Monday from 6.30-7.30pm at Dance HQ, 411 White Studios, Templeton on the Green, Templeton Street.
