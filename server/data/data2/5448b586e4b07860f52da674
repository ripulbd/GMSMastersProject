THE sunglasses, part of the Hempeyewear brand, are a joint business venture of Sam Whitten and Bradley Smith. Made in Glasgow: Cannabis sunglasses from Caledonian University graduate duo receive hefty public backing - Daily Record CALEDONIAN University graduates went green when they designed a pair of sunglasses made from cannabis.
The sunglasses, part of the Hempeyewear brand, are a joint business venture of Sam Whitten and Bradley Smith.
Brand designer Smith said: “Part of the inspiration was that hemp is such a versatile material that was used commonly for centuries, yet few people are aware of its properties.
“Using industrial hemp to make sunglasses as opposed to say, plastic, has environmental benefits, as it uses the offcuts of a plant that is already chopped down. We just really like the way the material looks and feels, and it has a nice smell to it.”
The pair were able to produce the glasses after securing &pound;37,367 through an online crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter.
Smith says the reaction to the product has been very enthusiastic.
He said: “At first people are bemused, then they understand it, then they want a pair. Before the crowdfunding campaign there was already a massive amount of attention from design blogs and the likes, and Sam showcased early prototypes at the New Designers show in London this summer to a great reception.”
Smith believes it’s beneficial being part of brand Glasgow.
He said: “It’ll mostly contribute to the thriving design industry, being an idea that was born here, and designed here. Glasgow has a manufacturing and industrial background and I think it is important that it retains some part of that.”
