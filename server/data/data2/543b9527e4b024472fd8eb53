Teenagers take on top cop roles TEENAGERS were given the chance to take on the role of a senior police officer in charge of a major disaster.More than 30 young people were invited to take part in a ground-breaking week-long work experience programme with Glasgow officers.The group from schools in Glasgow, East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire were given an insight into the thin blue line, to see what it takes to become a police officer.Sergeant Caroline Harden told how the teenagers sampled officers' training to prepare for major incidents.She told the Evening Times: &quot;We developed a new prog-ramme that was relevant to youth employability and helped young people with the transition from school to the work place.&quot;It was really helpful to see how much training the police go through to deal with a major incident.&quot;They were taught specific tactics and got an insight into the planning behind the scenes that they didn't know about before.&quot;We tried to make the scenarios as real as possible - it could be anything, for example a train crash - and the young people made the decisions on what happens next in terms of the operation.&quot;The teenagers' worked alongside officers in a Glasgow police station and took part in training sessions at the Scottish Police College in Tulliallan, Perthshire.It is hoped the scheme, which leads to a qualification, will boost Police Scotland recruitment and help enhance the youngsters' skills.Sgt Harden, who organised the programme, said the experience was helping teenagers develop new skills that would put them ahead in the jobs market.The pupils beat off competition from scores of applicants to land one of the sought-after positions.She added: &quot;The work experience may have only lasted a week, but those who took part have already developed new skills.&quot;rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
