More than 1200 people were fed by just four food banks across Glasgow in just one month - more than double the number from the previous year. Four city food banks feed 1200 people in a month More than 1200 people were fed by just four food banks across Glasgow in just one month - more than double the number from the previous year.Shocking new figures compiled by the Trussell Trust charity show the number of people who face going hungry in the city is continuing to rise.Last month a total of 1215 desperate people turned to the charity's four food banks in the city.Of that figure there were 797 adults and 418 children.This is a dramatic rise compared to the 566 people - 360 adults and 206 youngsters - the charity fed in August 2013.The Trussell Trust-backed food banks in Glasgow are in the city's North-east, the North-west, the South-east and the south-west.Ewan Gurr, Scotland network manager for the Trussell Trust, said the numbers were continuing to rise and he saw no sign of that changing.He said: &quot;Looking at the statistics they appear shocking because there has been a big spike.&quot;Across Scotland the trend is continuing.&quot;There is no sign that any-thing is changing. Food banks are not going away any time soon.&quot;Glasgow has the highest number in Scotland but that's because it's the highest populated area.&quot;However, these figures could just be the tip of the iceberg as there are thought to be more than 50 food banks in Glasgow.Mr Gurr said the financial situation of many people was not improving for several reasons.He added: &quot;People are not able to put food on the table because the cost of living is extortionate.&quot;Wages are not rising with inflation and thenif you add in the welfarereforms it is a lethal concoction.&quot;The Evening Times' Food for Thought campaign is calling for a more co-ordinated approach to food banks and to remove the stigma attached to them.We have been campaigning to help raise awareness of food banks and to make sure no one across the city is in any doubt as to where to turn if they need support.Our campaign has also highlighted the huge amount of work carried out by volunteers. Mr Gurr said his teams were taken aback by the kindness and generosity of people in recent weeks.Since last Friday, after the independence referendum, he said they had been inundated with offers of help.He said: &quot;So many people have given us food donations in the past week. One of our food banks inGlasgow said they had 25 people ask if they could volunteer to support vulnerable residents.&quot;We now need everyone to start tackling food poverty.&quot;Earlier this year we reported how nearly 10,000 people had turned to food banks in Glasgow during 2012/13 because they could not afford to eat or feed their families.It came as preparations got underway for a second George Square food collection in the city.From noon today, anti-poverty campaigners Andrew and Darren Carnegie were set to host a peace rally and food collection in the civic centre.As we reported, they want to distribute groceries to food banks across the city.
