Thousands pitched up in full costume for Scottish Comic Con at Glasgow’s SECC.
Spider-Men rubbed shoulders with Star Wars troopers and Doctor Who and The X-Men’s Nightcrawler also made appearances.
Supervillain Harley Quinn was there – and there was even a female version of burger mascot Ronald McDonald.

Comic Con was also the launch venue of the second instalment of Scotland’s only superhero comic – Saltire, created by John Ferguson.
Blurring the line between Scottish history and mythology, the comics focus on pivotal moments in the country’s past.
They have already won critical success with rave reviews.
Claire Ferguson, managing director of publisher Diamondsteel Comics, said: “He’s the only Scottish superhero.
“There’s been superheroes that are Scottish but never predominantly about Scottish characters.
“A few years ago there was an article online that suggested Scotland could never have a superhero as it is too drab and dreich.
“John Ferguson found that very annoying, turned everything twee on its head and made it cool.”
