Pub boss fined £17k over illegal Sky games THE manageress of a Glasgow pub has been fined £17,000 after illegally screening sports matches on satellite TV.Sarah McIntosh managed The Avalon Bar, in Kent Road, Charing Cross, when Sky Sports channels were shown without a licence.But Sky TV bosses were awarded a court order at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to stop the illegal screenings.McIntosh will now have to stump up &pound;10,000 in damages and &pound;7000 in fines.Costs have also been awarded against her, which are yet to be assessed.Alison Dolan, Deputy Managing Director, Sky Business, said: &quot;This issue is very close to the hearts of those pubs who pay Sky subscriptions because they are being left short-changed by licensees broadcasting Sky content illegally.&quot;It creates an uneven playing field for their businesses, which is why we are committed to visiting thousands of pubs this season, as well as investigating suppliers and continuing to take legal action against those licensees who choose to televise Sky content illegally.&quot;Sky's successful court order has led to the firm raising a number of actions to prevent other landlords from infringing their copyright.Interim interdicts have been awarded against nine licence holders across Scotland who are now subject to legal action.Colin Hulme, partner and head of the Burness Paull team acting for Sky in the civil cases, said: &quot;This raft of cases demonstrates that Sky is working hard to protect their customers in Scotland.&quot;I am confident that this result illustrates that those showing Sky programming without having entered into the correct commercial subscription with Sky Business will face legal action.&quot;The Kent Road pub is now called 'Whiski Kraft'.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk
