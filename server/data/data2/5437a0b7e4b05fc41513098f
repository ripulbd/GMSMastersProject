John Swinney: 'My plan will protect vulnerable and grow Scotland's economy' YESTERDAY I announced details of a Budget which will build a prosperous and fair Scotland and deliver on the asks of Scottish people who spoke out and showed their thirst for change, during the referendum.These plans will grow our economy, tackle inequalities and allow us to continue to protect and invest in public services.While Scotland's economy continues to go from strength to strength, Westminster cuts have made our Budget for 2015-16 particularly challenging.We have had to make some tough decisions, but rest assured we are still doing everything we can to protect household budgets.From April 1, the unfair and outdated system of Stamp Duty with be replaced with a more progressive tax.The Land and Buildings Transaction Tax will be more closely linked to people's ability to afford the property they want and will help those on low incomes and first time buyers.It's evident that too many Scottish households are still struggling to meet their bills.Our Budget will support free personal care for the elderly and the abolition of tuition fees.We will fund free school meals for all P1-P3 pupils and make sure prescriptions and eye exams remain free.And by providing money to allow councils to freeze the Council Tax, we are putting money in the pockets of families up and down the country.In addition, we are supporting the Scottish Living Wage, which will protect the pay of the lowest earners within our public sector, and delivering a pay rise for nursing staff.To help parents in Glasgow who want to get back to work we are expanding childcare to 600 hours for all three and four-year-olds and the most vulnerable two-year-olds.This is helping our youngest children and reducing cost pressures on parents.And to support young people into work we will maintain free higher education, continue to fund college places across the country and invest in Modern Apprenticeships.As our largest city, Glasgow and the surrounding area is central to driving Scotland's economic growth.That's why we are investing &pound;500 million in a City Deal benefitting the Glasgow and Clyde-Valley area over the next 20 years, part of a &pound;1.13billion infra- structure investment fund, which the local authorities expect to deliver around 29,000 jobs.We are strengthening our transport links through work on the M8, M73 and M74 and improvements to the Glasgow and Edinburgh rail services.We are developing our health service to meet the changing demands, with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde set to benefit from a funding boost in 2015/16.This comes on top of our support for high quality health facilities through the New South Glasgow Hospitals Project and development of Maryhill, Gorbals and Woodside Health Centres.This Budget builds on the track record we've set since 2007, and prioritises policies that help hard working families, protect the vulnerable and grow our economy.
