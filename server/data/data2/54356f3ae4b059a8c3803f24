The Ultimo owner had already indicated she would move her firm to England in the event of a Yes vote.
She said today she remains concerned about the lack of clarity over the currency issue.“How can you run a country without knowing these questions,” she said today.
“I hope it will be No because I’m very very scared at the moment.
“There’s too many unanswered questions even after two years - we’re voting for the unknown and why would you do that.”
Ms Mone has previously complained about abuse she received on social media after speaking out for No, even suggesting she no longer felt safe in Scotland.
