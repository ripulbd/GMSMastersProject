The Hope over Fear event was organised by the socialist campaign for an independent Scotland.
It was one of the biggest of its kind since the referendum on Scottish independence was held on 18 September.
Tommy Sheridan, co-convener of Solidarity Scotland, told the rally they were at &quot;the end of the beginning&quot; of the campaign for independence.
Mr Sheridan said: &quot;Some of you who are old enough will remember the last titanic battle with the British establishment that was taken to the brink - the 1984/5 miners' strike.
&quot;I remember the South Wales miners' marching back to work in March of 1985 with a banner that is applicable to us here today. That banner read: this is the end. The end of the beginning.
&quot;This is the end of the beginning.&quot;
Actor Martin Compston told the rally: &quot;We were promised substantial change, and we demand that substantial change, because 45% wanted complete change and the vast majority of the 55 (percentage who voted No) want something substantial.
&quot;Firstly we are here to achieve that, and secondly, this movement is going nowhere.&quot;
