Exclusive: Hear Craig Armstrong's latest single featuring Suede frontman Brett Anderson from his new album It’s Nearly Tomorrow - Daily Record MOVIE composer Craig Armstrong is giving Daily Record readers a Scottish exclusive preview of the new single from his forthcoming album featuring Suede frontman Brett Anderson.
The world-renowned Glasgow musician, who has written the movie scores for blockbuster flicks including Moulin Rouge, Love Actually and The Great Gatsby, will release new album It’s Nearly Tomorrow on October 13.
The Suede frontman provides the vocals on epic new track Crash.

As with previous albums, The Space Between Us and As if To Nothing, on which he has worked with guests vocalists including U2’s Bono , Lemonheads singer Evan Dando, Liz Fraser of The Cocteau Twins and Irish singer Sinead O’Connor, Armstrong has again worked with guest vocalists including Love &amp;&nbsp; Money’s James Grant and Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile.
Glasgow singer Katie O’Halloran and regular collaborator Jerry Burns also&nbsp; feature.
The composer, a Grammy, BAFTA and Golden Globe winner, wrote most of the album while in Australia working on Baz Luhrmann’s Gatsby last year.
 

It was recorded all over the world in Glasgow, Berlin, Prague, London, Sweden, Finland and Los Angeles.
The musician, a former member of Scots bands Hipsway and Texas , said: “In an old-fashioned way, I think it is an A to Z album. Each track is informed by the track before it and the end of the album makes particular sense if you listen from the beginning.”
And of the album’s title, the 55-year-old said: “It’s to do with looking back at life but it’s also quite optimistic, dealing with things that are a little bit sad. But in a way that is honest and hopeful. I see it as quite a romantic album.”
