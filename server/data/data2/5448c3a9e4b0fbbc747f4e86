OWNERS of empty city centre buildings are being urged to offer them for short-term lease. Call for short-term lets to boost city centre shopping OWNERS of empty city centre buildings are being urged to offer them for short-term lease.It is hoped the move would encourage entrepreneurs and keep Glasgow's main shopping hub vibrant and busy.The call was made by Dan Hill, a director of the London based Future Cities Catapult, an organisation which brings a wide range of groups together to develop solutions to the future needs of cities.Mr Hill revealed his views at the recent Tomorrow's City Centre conference organised by Glasgow Chamber of CommerceHe is trying to encourage owners of city centre shops which are lying empty to lease them out on a month by month basis.That would allow start-up companies to open a shop without being tied into a long-term lease if the business failed, and would also provide an income for building owners.A similar scheme was tried out in Australia, and according to Mr Hill, has proved a great success.He pointed out there are already empty shop premises in Glasgow city centre and that number is likely to increase because of the growing popularity of internet shopping.Mr Hill said: &quot;In Newcastle, Australia the city centre began to become less well used because they built an out of town shopping centre and people were moving to the suburbs. Between 40 and 50 city centre properties were lying empty until a local man decided to do something about it.Mr Hill added: &quot;There were reports of people looking to rent spaces for workshops, food co-ops and galleries but they couldn't get access to them because they were owned by major property companies who were usually looking for a 10 to 20 year lease.&quot;But if you are an entrepreneur with half an idea you cannot guarantee 20 years.&quot;He talked to the property owners and they came up with the idea of a rolling 30-day lease.&quot;The tenants did up the spaces which were a bit rundown because they hadn't been used for a long time.&quot;It sounds stunningly simple but was a big breakthrough because they was no public money involved in what was urban regeneration. It has completely turned the area around.&quot;There is also beginning to be a snowball effect and they are starting to see other businesses who want to be part of it.&quot;Mr Hill believes a similar scheme could prove to be a success in parts of Glasgow city centre.He said: &quot;There are many great shops in Glasgow but with the trends moving further towards internet shopping there are serious questions about how much retail the city centre can support.&quot;Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, admitted he is interested in the idea of rolling leases and wants to explore it further.He said: &quot;We are probably having to face up to the prospect that a lot of traditional shop units are going to need new uses.&quot;The big concern is that people stick to the old ways and wait and hope the market is going to turn and the space lies vacant for years.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk
