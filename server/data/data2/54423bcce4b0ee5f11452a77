 Ross County are without injured trio Timothy Dreesen, Rocco Quinn and Uros Celcer for the visit of Celtic. 
 The Staggies are waiting for international clearance to include new arrivals Jamie Reckord, Martin Woods and Terry Dunfield. 
 Celtic welcome back Charlie Mulgrew, Mikael Lustig and Adam Matthews from injuries but James Forrest remains out. 
 Emilio Izaguirre, Efe Ambrose and Wakaso Mubarak will be assessed on arrival back from international duty. 
  Ross County manager Jim McIntyre:  &quot;Any time the champions come to your ground it's a great occasion and you want to do well in the game. We want to do the best we can in front of our own support. 
 &quot;We've done particularly well over the years [against Celtic] but each game is different and it's up to this team to go and make their mark on the game. 
 &quot;We want to continue on from where we left off before the international break.&quot; 
  Celtic manager Ronny Deila:  &quot;We were on a good run and had a setback against Hamilton so we need to get back on track and bounce back. 
 &quot;We want to win and we will go up there to win the game. We will need a very good performance and we need to be more clinical. 
 &quot;We have to start winning games and get up the league as the results in the league haven't been good enough.&quot;
