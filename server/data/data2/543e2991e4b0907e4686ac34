Scottish slang baffles celebs such as David Guetta, Aloe Blacc and Zach Braff as they prepare for big MTV bash - Daily Record CELEBRITIES including David Guetta, Aloe Blacc, and Zach Braff have been trying to practise Scottish slang ahead of the MTV EMA awards.
The big bash takes place at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro on November 9 and in advance of all the activities, MTV decided to ask some actors and musicians what they thought about some of our special words.
Asked what &quot;Braw&quot; meant I Need A Dollar hitmaker Aloe Blacc said: “In California when we call somebody Braw we call them Whassup Bro.”
Global DJ David Guetta was so confused by the word, saying: “Does it stand for brother? Wow what language is this?”
Zach thought Winch stood for something rude. He said: “Winch is when you really have to pee very very badly and you hold it in so long that you no longer have to pee any more.”
Aloe Blacc suggested: “It’s only half a sandwich.”
Singer Charli XCX was confused by the word Geggy thinking: “It’s a really fit boy” while &nbsp;Aloe Blacc thought it meant “a hairy legged man”.&nbsp;
Zach felt it might mean a “Really really hot grandma that you didn’t think you were going to hook up.”
The word Dreich also got bemused looks as Zach advised it meant: “A dirty, dirty, dirty girl” &nbsp;and Skelpit raised eyebrows when Aloe Blacc said: “When I go to the barber and I don’t feel like having my affro anymore I just tell them Skelpit.”
David Guetta added: “I have no idea what this means man. I’m French.”&nbsp;
