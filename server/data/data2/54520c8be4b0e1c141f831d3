Moira's family's courage is a great lesson FORMER Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini told the Evening Times how the humility and dignity shown by the family of murdered businesswoman Moira Jones has given her "a great lesson in life".The Govan-born QC, who prosecuted Moira's Slovakian killer Marek Harcar, praised her parents Bea and Hu for their &quot;immeasurable courage&quot; since the horror rape and murder of their daughter.Ms Angiolini is a patron for the Moira Jones Fund, set up in memory of the 40-year-old who was the victim of a &quot;vile and barbaric&quot; rape and torture in Queen's Park in Glasgow's South Side after being abducted yards from her home in May, 2008.She became involved in the charity after standing down as Lord Advocate because she was &quot;truly touched&quot; by the courage of Moira's family and wanted to support the fund.Ms Angiolini, 54, turned up to support Bea and her family at the 5k Moira's Run last week in the park where her body was found, which was attended by more than 350 people.She will also be attending The Moira Fund Ball at Glasgow University Union this Saturday.Ms Angiolini said: &quot;I didn't know Moira and I came into this in very tragic circumstances.&quot;I prosecuted Marek Harcar and it was only once I retired as Lord Advocate that I could really become involved in the charity.&quot;It would not have been appropriate as Lord Advocate to do that, but afterwards I did keep contact with the family who had been just so strong during that trial.&quot;Their courage and dignity was just immeasurable, and a great lesson in life for me in terms of the humility they showed through this.&quot;They were determined not to allow this awful tragedy to this wonderful, wonderful daughter of theirs to be something so negative, so they were determined to try and do something to transform the lives of others and assist those in similar circumstances to themselves to get the support they need.&quot;It is a very practical charity, tragically informed by their own expertise.&quot;Although it's borne of a tragedy, it is very forward thinking and reflects the joy that Moira brought to other people's lives.&quot;She was fun-loving, a character and very outgoing and that's what I heard during the trial as well. I heard what a real dynamo she was and how loved she was.&quot;The Moira Fund gives grants to families bereaved through violent death and provides access to specialist counselling and respite.Moira's Run raised &pound;7000 and money is still coming in.Ms Angiolini said: &quot;I thought the coverage of Moira's Run in the Evening Times was fantastic.&quot;I was there but I didn't run because I have a slipped disc. I was there with Elaine C. Smith, who does an awful lot for the charity as well.&quot;The rain was horrendous but it was brilliant. The park is so beautiful and it was great to see it filled by such warm, caring people.&quot;The Glasgow people are wonderful.&quot;Every time I come back to Glasgow I feel recharged. There is such a generosity of heart.&quot;The Moira Fund is her legacy and the whole family are continuing that in ensuring that others are helped.&quot;It has been very difficult and painful for Bea to do this, but through her great courage she is doing this and lobbying for an understanding of the difficulties for people in these circumstances, and to make sure there is much greater knowledge and more control over the whereabouts of criminals from abroad.&quot;For anyone in these circumstances it is a living hell afterwards, and all you can do is make the days pass by in a bearable way - and instead of being consumed by that, Bea has risen up to the challenge of still making sure that Moira's life was meaningful by ensuring that the lives of others are made better.&quot;Those who take part in these events get great joy out of it too.&quot;You cannot help but be affected and learn from her and her husband Hu: they are such a wonderful couple.&quot;It is a great privilege for me to help in some small way to support this great charity.&quot;janice.burns@eveningtimes.co.uk
