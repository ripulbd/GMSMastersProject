A THIRD of children in Glasgow are still living in poverty, according to figures released today. Challenge Poverty: Shock figures reveal city's shame A THIRD of children in Glasgow are still living in poverty, according to figures released today.The statistics published by the Campaign to End Child Poverty show as many as 40% of children in some areas of the city are living below the breadline.Researchers also predict a surge in the number of destitute children in the next six years if drastic action is not taken.The Glasgow Central constituency, which covers Govan, Kelvin, Shettleston, Pollok and Rutherglen, has a rate of 41% - the highest in Scotland.Around four in every 10 families living in these areas are surviving on less than &pound;404 a week, with single parent families with two children living on less than &pound;317 per week.In other areas of Glasgow the picture is just as bleak, with 37% of children in Glasgow North East living below the breadline.The lowest area of child poverty in the city is Glasgow South at 28%, followed by Glasgow North (29%), North West (31%), East (32%) and South West (33%).According to the Scottish Government, relative poverty is where total household income is less than 60% of the average.For a couple with two children this means surviving on less than &pound;21,000 a year, and for a single parent-of-two it means an annual income of less than &pound;16,500.John Dickie, director of Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) in Scotland, blamed stagnant salaries and benefits cuts for the high numbers of families struggling to cope.Mr Dickie said: &quot;The fact that one in three children in Glasgow is living in poverty is nothing short of scandalous.&quot;Flat lining wages and dwindling benefits are leaving more and more families struggling just to make ends meet.&quot;We cannot forget the thousands of children behind these statistics -those whose health, happiness and prospects are being thwarted by poverty.&quot;Too many are being denied the things that all children have a right to enjoy - things like a secure home, a healthy diet and warm clothes.&quot;This has to be addressed as a matter of urgency with UK, Scottish and local government using every power at their disposal to increase family incomes and make sure that children in Glasgow and across Scotland are given the best possible start in life.&quot;Campaigners are demanding action at a local and national level to reduce the numbers across the country. They have warned that unless drastic action is taken to rethink the tax and benefits structures, an extra 100,000 youngsters will be pushed into poverty by 2020.Neil Mathers, spokesman for the Campaign to End Child Poverty, said: &quot;These figures reveal just how widely and deeply child poverty reaches into our communities.&quot;It's important we look behind these figures at what is driving this level of poverty in our country.&quot;Politicians of all parties, at Westminster and Holyrood, need to act to tackle the root causes of poverty, including low pay and soaring housing and childcare costs.&quot;There is nothing inevitable about this poverty. We must build on the good work in Scotland to support families.&quot;Mr Mathers emphasised the need to focus on child poverty and said the findings &quot;reinforce the urgent need for more action.&quot;He said: &quot;We know there is ambition in Scotland to do more. We now need to act so all our children have a fair start. We can and must do better for our children.&quot;hannah.rodger@ eveningtimes.co.ukCONFERENCE DISCUSSES INEQUALITYTRADE UNION body the STUC were today holding a conference to discuss ways to challenge the county's issues of inequality.The Decent Work: Dignified Lives event in Glasgow was to see Alex Salmond give his first conference speech following his announcement to resign as First Minister.Issues discussed include tax, benefits and wages, with speakers highlighting the need for more powers for Holyrood.Grahame Smith, STUC general secretary, said: &quot;Today's conference provides a space where new and effective policies to tackle inequality can start to be debated and developed.&quot;We will demonstrate that there are a number of policy interventions, barely investigated during the referendum debate, some of which can be delivered now, and some of which could be more effectively delivered with a substantial package of further devolved powers.&quot;It has been frustrating to see key issues on which the two main political parties largely agree - childcare, living wage, public ownership of the railways, the need to look again at local taxation - become the subject of such extreme division.&quot;We can do better than this.&quot;Government at all levels, whatever their powers, can influence the labour market and promote decent wages, but we need to look very seriously now at whether Scotland should have more powers, particularly in the area of employment regulation.&quot;Mr Smith said despite good recommendations in a review of Scottish workplace policies, action needed to be taken by Holyrood and employers to make changes immediately.Professor Karel Williams, accounting and economics professor at Manchester Business School, will also appear at the event alongside economists Professor Danny Blanchflower and Frances Coppola.Mr Williams will argue that Scotland is a country which is &quot;more shockingly territorially divided than the rest of the UK&quot;, due to the fact almost 15% of Scots are living in failing local economies, compared to only 4% in the rest of the UK.
