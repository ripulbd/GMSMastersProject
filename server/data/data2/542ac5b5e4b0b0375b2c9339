Bid to heal indyref divisions Experts in conflict resolution are to take part in a special online "day of dialogue" being staged in a bid to heal divisions caused by the independence referendum.The event on Friday is being organised by the Cyrenians Scottish Centre for Conflict Resolution (SCCR) and aims to give people some tips and tools on how to deal with conflict at home, at work or with friends.Diane Marr, development manager at the Edinburgh-based charity and the lead behind its SCCR initiative, said: &quot;We want to try to do something that helps pass on some expert advice to those people on how to resolve conflict and play even just a small part in trying to heal some of the rifts that have come about.&quot;Those who will be taking to Twitter on Friday, October 3 include Stephen O'Rourke, a member of the Faculty of Advocates, and experts from Edinburgh firm Drummond International, which provides professional, business and personal development services.The charity is keen for members of the public who have resolved their own differences over the referendum to share their experiences on social media.Ms Marr stressed: &quot;We are not party political and have no partisan views.&quot;Part of the ethos of the SCCR's work is giving families, parents and young people the tools to help them work through arguments and resolve conflict.&quot;It feels like a lot of people are struggling just now with different and often very polar views, often across families, friends and even partners.&quot;She stated that the referendum, which saw Scots vote by 55% to 45% in favour of staying in the UK, had brought about &quot;celebration and elation&quot; for some but a &quot;great sense of loss, disappointment and frustration&quot; for others.She added: &quot;Holding strong views, opinions and values that are different from others can generate division and conflict.&quot;Arguments happen every day with friends and family and, at times, even these can go too far.&quot;We must get better at dealing with conflict and difference of opinion. Post-referendum we have no choice or we risk being a divided nation.&quot;Mr O'Rourke said: &quot;Talking to friends and family, I think there is a remaining undercurrent of conflict that has the potential to boil over again throughout the stages of the coming journey.&quot;Much of the debate has been civilised and carried out in a manner that should make Scotland proud.&quot;But this initiative is aimed at ensuring we can keep that up in the months to come. I hope to share some ideas to help resolve any sense of conflict.&quot;More details can be found at http://blog.scottishconflictresolution.org.uk/
