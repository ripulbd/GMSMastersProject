 A Jonny Hayes goal after two minutes settled a drab game. 
 &quot;We've been far better this season and tossed away points,&quot; McInnes told BBC Scotland. &quot;What was required more than anything was a real solid performance. 
 &quot;I don't think we gave Motherwell any opportunities, we defended really well, so the clean-sheet, concentration and discipline are positives.&quot; 
 Aberdeen were thumped 3-0 by Hamilton in last Friday's Premiership offering and McInnes made changes, including dropping top scorer Adam Rooney and goalkeeper Jamie Langfield. 
 Replacement keeper Scott Brown was seldom troubled as Motherwell failed to muster any attacking menace, although he did have a couple of shaky moments from first-half set-pieces. 
 &quot;The players look a bit down but they should be pleased because winning is difficult,&quot; added McInnes. 
 &quot;Motherwell played in front of us and kept possession, which caused us to be a bit anxious and when we won the ball back we were loose at times. 
 &quot;We scored a very good goal, which is another positive, and we were never really stretched from then on. 
 &quot;We wanted to impose ourselves on the game and I thought we started well. We were sharp to the ball. 
 &quot;Our experience at the back was important. We were a bit frustrated in the middle of the park because we were dying to get in touch with people and we couldn't quite get there. 
 &quot;All in all, we know we can play a lot better. 
 &quot;But we play Hamilton here on Wednesday in the League Cup and if we get through to the semi-final not playing as well as we can, I'll take that as well.&quot;
