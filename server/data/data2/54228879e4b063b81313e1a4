Grandstand role at Ryder Cup for jobless youngsters SEVEN jobless Glaswegians are getting the chance to play their part in one of Scotland's biggest sporting events this week.In an experience of a lifetime, they will join 50 young people from across the country to work at the famous Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in Perthshire, which kicks off on Friday.As a team of volunteers they will get the opportunity to meet top players from Europe and the US and soak up the atmosphere at the golfing event which will attract 45,000 spectators and millions of TV viewers each day.They will be helping out at the grandstands on the 18th green so they will be in a prime spot to witness the sporting spectacular.Their dream of being involved in such a huge event came true through Scotland's Best volunteering programme delivered by Barnado's, The Prince's Trust, Volunteer Scotland, Action for Children and Jobs &amp; Business Glasgow on behalf of Skills Development Scotland.Ben Queenan, 18, from Bridgeton; Jordan Tracey,18, from Tollcross; Conor McGowan, 17, from Bailleston; Ross McKenzie, 18, and his brother Robbie, 20, from Springburn; and Pollok lads David Whitten, 18, and Francis Donnelly, 16, are already on their way to Gleneagles.Four of them - Francis, David and the McKenzie brothers - met up with their Jobs &amp; Business Glasgow mentors for a practice run and challenge match at Lethamhill Golf Course near the city's Hogganfield Loch.David said: &quot;This course has given me the opportunity to work closely with my mentor at Jobs &amp; Business Glasgow to learn new skills such as where to look for vacancies, how to prepare my CV for each job that I apply for as well as giving me a better understanding of what the recruitment and interview process will be like.&quot;I have gained a lot through the programme but I cannot really believe that I will have the opportunity to work at the Ryder Cup.&quot;I am a massive golf fan and have watched the Ryder Cup since I was about 10, so getting to see heroes like Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia will be amazing... go team Europe!&quot;We will be working at the grandstands on the 18th hole so if we have a finish like the last Ryder Cup we will be in a prime spot to witness real sporting history. I can't wait.&quot;Jordan said: &quot;Getting the chance to volunteer at one of the world's biggest sporting events is a great opportunity, maybe a once in a lifetime one.&quot;Their mentors - Nicky Carroll, Clare McLaughlin and David Ferris - said 10 unemployed youngsters originally signed up to help out at the Ryder Cup.Clare said: &quot;Of the 10 young people who had originally signed up for the Jobs &amp; Business Glasgow Ryder Cup Experience, three have already moved onto either jobs or further education.&quot;The volunteering experience will not only be a great occasion for the seven young people but it will also give them invaluable work experience, boosting their CVs and their confidence&quot;.Catherine Thomas, Skills Development Scotland Commonwealth Games Legacy manager, said: &quot;Scotland's Best is all about creating a lasting legacy and we have already seen hundreds of young people benefit from the programme, especially when Glasgow hosted the Commonwealth Games.&quot;The Ryder Cup gives us a chance to take this one step further.&quot;
