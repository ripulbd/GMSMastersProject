Get Ready for the Weekend by listening to his new album in a Glasgow taxi Superstar DJ Calvin Harris has been helping Glasgow clubbers Get Ready for the Weekend by offering them a first listen of his new album in a unique taxi experience.The Scot's new album Motion is to be released on Monday and to celebrate a special taxi is offering revellers a free ride in Glasgow and a chance to listen to the album.The Motion taxi was travelling around the city centre tonight and will be in Glasgow tomorrow night.Special Motion branded cabs will also be in Manchester and London.Derek Allan, who has been a taxi driver for 10 years, took charge of the Motion cab in Glasgow.He said: &quot;I am sure my passengers will appreciate the music. I will give my passengers an option but I think most people will listen to the album. There is a lot of varied tracks there, a lot for the young ones and a lot of soothing tracks too.&quot;Derek also admitted he is a fan of the DJ citing &quot;Summer,&quot; as his favourite track.Passenger Fiona Watson, from Glasgow, said: &quot;I like the new album and I think it is better than the last album because the tracks are more varied.&quot;If the taxi drivers can handle playing the music, I think this could take off.&quot;Passenger Lisa Carroll, from Glasgow, added: &quot;I loved it. I am huge Calvin Harris fan and I like this album better than the last.&quot;I think this would put you in the mood for going out at the weekends.&quot;My verdict:I took a ride in the taxi, and I think it is the perfect way to start the weekend. Music has always been a big part of my going out routine. I listen to music when I get ready, and I get excited when I am in a taxi and a good song comes on. I think this could really take off.As for Calvin Harris' album, I have to admit on first listen I love it.Outside featuring Ellie Goulding will be huge hit for Calvin while other tracks like Slow Acid will please the clubbers.This album will be as every bit successful as 18 Months because every song is a track that people simply want to dance to.
