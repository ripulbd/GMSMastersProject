GUISEPPE Trimani, 58, was caught holding a shopping bag that contained two blocks of 63 per cent pure cocaine in the cereal box. Brazen drug dealer caught carrying cocaine worth £160k inside CORNFLAKES box - Daily Record A BRAZEN drug supplier was caught carrying cocaine worth &pound;160,000 inside a cornflakes box.
Painter and decorator Guiseppe Trimani was holding a shopping bag that contained two blocks of 63 per cent pure cocaine in the cereal box.
He also had two blocks of a cutting agent used to mix with the Class A drug when he was stopped in Bearsden, near Glasgow.
Officers found &pound;2550 in &pound;50 notes in a trouser pocket when he was searched at a police station.
A metal bowl with traces of white powder, two pairs of gloves and a set of digital scales were discovered during a search at his home in Mansewood, Glasgow.
Trimani, 58, pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow to being concerned in the supply of cocaine on September 5 last year.
Angela Gray, prosecuting, said Trimani was stopped after detectives received confidential information.
She added: “Police express the opinion that the maximum achievable street level figure from the cocaine recovered is &pound;160,000.”
Tony Graham, defending, said his client “developed a cocaine habit and found himself in debt” which rose to &pound;7500 through interest.
He added: “He became involved in this enterprise to pay off the debt.”
Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentence until next month. Trimani was remanded in custody.
