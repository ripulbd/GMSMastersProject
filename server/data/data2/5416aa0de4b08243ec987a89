A PERMANENT roller disco could put dancers in a spin and give a new generation a taste of wheelie good rock and roll in Glasgow. Roller disco revival! A PERMANENT roller disco could put dancers in a spin and give a new generation a taste of wheelie good rock and roll in Glasgow.RollerStop mobile disco has signed a 10-year lease for part of a building in Middlesex Street, Kinning Park, and hopes to open early next January.The company, which has been running mobile roller discos for three years with events in Glasgow, Paisley and Edinburgh, says the retro discos are booming business and have been growing in popularity.RollerStop manager Suzie Beith said the firm had staged 104 discos this year and had been looking for a more permanent base when the Kelvin Hall - one of its temporary venues - closed.She said: &quot;We want to run more events and more lessons.&quot;Creating atmosphere in a sports hall is difficult and clubs are a bit too small. The rink will have a real disco feel that adults and children alike can enjoy.&quot;Ms Beith said the firm regularly held events at The Arc, Barrowland and the Kelvin Hall, and held an 80s night for over-18s at The Garage on Friday, which sold out.Other forthcoming events include two sessions at Scotstoun Leisure Centre on September 21, for families with young children and those aged over eight, and on October 12.Ms Beith added: &quot;We can take up to 150 at the discos. More people are getting interested in them.&quot;Director Siobhan Lawson said the firm was launching a Crowdfunder scheme to help pay the cost of fitting out the venue. It wants the public to help raise &pound;5000 with a reward system that would offer ticket deals in return for a pledge of money.The scheme, which was launched this month, runs for four weeks.Ms Lawson said: &quot;All funds raised through this campaign will be used to buy essential items such as heating, lockers, seating and cafe equipment. We are a community interest company so all profits generated by the business will be reinvested to improve facilities and run more events.&quot;She said the firm would offer regular events for all levels and abilities plus lessons in figure skating, slalom and hockey skills.It hopes to open the venue for an adults preview party on December 27 and a party for families the next day. It aims to open full time from January 5.Roller discos are enjoying a surge in popularity after a US-led resurgence, with 14 dedicated rinks opening in America in the past 12 months.Ms Beith said the firm's clients ranged from those &quot;reliving their youth&quot; to their children, and even grandchildren, turning to the sport for the first time.She said others were &quot;die-hard skaters who have been rocking and rolling their whole life.&quot;The company started in October 2011 as a &quot;small group of skaters meeting in a hall once a week.&quot; Ms Beith said the company now has more than 400 pairs.As well as the public events, it also does hen nights, birthday parties and corporate events.She said: &quot;In the summer of 2013 we hired a small unit at SWG3 in Glasgow and ran our roller disco from there. Although the space was not ideal, we learned a lot from the experience.&quot;With what we have learned from the past three years, we are equipped and very ready to open a permanent space.&quot;For more details see: www.skateglasgow.com or www.crowdfunder.co.uk/roller-rink-for-glasgowvictoria.brenan@eveningtimes.co.uk
