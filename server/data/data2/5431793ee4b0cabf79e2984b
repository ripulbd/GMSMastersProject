Amunai Hobbs, 41, also known as Amunai Nicholson, left her home in Oban on Wednesday to catch a flight to Thailand.
She left Glasgow Airport the following day to attend Royal Alexandra Hospital reporting that she felt unwell, and there have been no confirmed sightings of her since she left the hospital at around 10.35am.
However, one report has placed her on Inchinnan Road, near Fleming Street, between 11.30am and 12.30pm.
The person who made the report stated that they don’t believe that she was wearing any shoes, Police said.
Ms Hobbs is from Thailand but lives in Scotland. She is described as around 4ft 10 inches in height and of slim build with short black hair. When last seen she was wearing a beige coloured fur coat, a purple dress with staining down the front, purple leggings and brown boots.
She was reported on Inchinnan Road wearing a grey cardigan with large buttons on the front, black cropped leggings and no shoes.
Inspector Gary Noonan, of Paisley Police Office, said: “Searches are continuing using a number of resources including the force helicopter and specialist search officers, however we have yet to trace Amunai.
“This is a very distressing time for her family and friends and they are extremely concerned for her wellbeing and safety. It is out of character for her not to keep in contact with them.
“I would urge anyone with any information on her whereabouts, or has seen someone matching her description to contact Paisley Police Office on 101.”
