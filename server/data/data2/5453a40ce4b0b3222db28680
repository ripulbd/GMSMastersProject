“Our Homes division has enjoyed a strong performance as confidence returns to the market with sales and footfall increasing consistently. We have to acknowledge the role Help to Buy (Scotland) has played in this, accounting for 11 per cent of purchases.
“With this pattern continuing well into the current financial year while funding was still available, it highlights how crucial initiatives that stimulate the market are to the industry.
“Social housing has been another key growth area for us with new partnerships with housing associations and local authorities demonstrating our ability to blend private sector innovation and expertise with the value for money requirements of public sector working.
“Our diversification strategy is bearing fruit but some of our most successful projects have integrated the specialist skills of several of our divisions, again showing the strength of partnership working to deliver an exceptional financial performance.”
