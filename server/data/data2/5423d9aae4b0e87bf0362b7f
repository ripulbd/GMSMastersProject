THEY have already gathered thousands of pounds worth of food in their mission to help starving people in Glasgow. Let's join forces and get this food to city's needy THEY have already gathered thousands of pounds worth of food in their mission to help starving people in Glasgow.And the father and son team behind the George Square food collection now want to help co-ordinate food banks - by handing over the stock to help the city's hungry.Andrew and Darren Carnegie, originally from Blackhill, want to become 'bankers' for food banks, to gather the tins, cereal, pasta and toiletries, and hand it over to the feeding stations all over Greater Glasgow.After their spontaneous collection last weekend, which saw people from across Scotland take bags of groceries to the civic centre of Glasgow, they are to host another peaceful gathering on Saturday.Their goodwill, which was in response to the violent scenes in the wake of the referendum outcome, has gone viral - they have become Facebook and Twitter sensations, and have been contacted by people from as far afield as Canada.The Evening Times first reported on the pair's quest to stop poverty at the end of September last year, when they were putting plans in place to help people from their Tollcross home.Since then they have fed around 1500 hungry people through their food bank, Glasgow's Needy.Darren, 25, said: &quot;We hope this Saturday is going to be that successful that we can become the bankers of food banks.&quot;If we become the bank of food banks then we can then push out to help the other food banks in Glasgow and support them in any way we can.&quot;I think it's important that everybody's stocked up - the plight and poverty of people in Glasgow is enormous.&quot;I can't think of any- thing worse than some- one going to a food bank for food and there's not enough.&quot;Darren, who works as a salesman, said he was &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the generosity of Glaswegians and expects thousands of people to turn up again on Saturday.He said: &quot;I'm overjoyed that the people of Glasgow have supported us.&quot;I'm hoping thousands of people turn up, it's going to be a fantastic day. It's a day for peace and unity in Glasgow and to feed the most poverty-stricken people in Glasgow.&quot;This is not about giving ourselves a pat in the back, this is about helping Glasgow's needy in any way we can.&quot;They are currently storing the food they have collected in premises loaned to them by takewaway Ruby Murrys, in Tollcross Road.In the supermarket bags gathered across the floor of the building are cereals, bags of pasta, tins, and even towels, which were all taken to the civic square by the public.Darren said: &quot;Some of the sights I've seen can only be described as horrific. It's as if we've got our own slum ghetto in Glasgow.&quot;Andrew, 45, urged people to visit their Facebook page www.facebook.com/glasgowsneedy to spread the word.He said: &quot;A click of a button can change peoples' lives.&quot;
