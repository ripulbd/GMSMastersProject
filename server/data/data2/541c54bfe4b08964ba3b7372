St Mirren: Striker Steven Thompson to undergo surgery  St Mirren's Steven Thompson faces three months on the sidelines, after manager Tommy Craig confirmed the striker needs surgery on a groin injury. 
 Captain Thompson was the Buddies' top scorer last season, netting 13 goals. 
 But the 35-year-old has featured just twice this term, with St Mirren yet to pick up a league point. 
 &quot;It's a massive blow. We now know he is going to be out for quite some time and it's a kick in the guts,&quot; manager Craig said. 
 &quot;I've tried hard not to talk about Stevie because it would sound like an excuse. 
 &quot;The people I brought in during the summer, Ross Caldwell, Callum Ball and James Marwood, were brought in to play alongside him so that he could educate them and they could take a bit of the weight off him,&quot; Craig added. 
 &quot;All of a sudden the talisman is not there but we just have to crack on.&quot; 
 St Mirren face Partick Thistle in the Premiership on Friday night.
