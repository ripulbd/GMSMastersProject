6|||THE name on the warrant - which went before Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday - was Marc O'Haire, 29, of Auchinairn, Bishopbriggs. Police issue warrant for arrest of man alleged to have murdered young dad John McFarlane outside house party - Daily Record A WARRANT has been issued for the arrest of a man alleged to have murdered a young dad.
It was secured by detectives who have been trying for a week to trace John McFarlane’s killer.
The name on the warrant – which went before Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday – was Marc O’Haire, 29, of Auchinairn, Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow.
He is wanted in connection with the murder of 28-year-old dad-of-one John, who was stabbed to death last Thursday night after leaving a house party in the village.
It was believed that a suspect fled the scene after the incident.
Grieving members of John’s family were worried that the suspect was still at large and called for him to hand himself in .
Their concerns led to police going to court yesterday to have an arrest warrant put before a sheriff.
A source said: “A petition for an arrest warrant was granted in the name of the man who is wanted in connection with this incident.
“It is not expected to be very long until he is picked up.”
John, father to three-year-old Aiden, is believed to have had an argument at the party and was later stabbed outside. He subsequently died in hospital.
John’s death has devastated the small community of Auchinairn.
He lived there with Elaine Keys – his long-term partner and the mother of his son – and had a wide network of family and friends who nicknamed him Jader.
A police spokeswoman refused to comment on the warrant and would only say: “We are following a positive line of inquiry.”###

8|||RUTH Geddes, 19, who went into hiding with her parents on Tuesday, has been detained by police and is being monitored round-the-clock in a psychiatric ward at Parkhead Hospital in Glasgow. Anorexic patient detained in psychiatric hospital despite her family's desperate plea for help - Daily Record A YOUNG woman with anorexia has been detained in a psychiatric hospital despite her family’s plea for help.
Ruth Geddes went into hiding with her parents on Tuesday after she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act by medics who feared the eating disorder was putting her life at risk.
 The family contacted the Daily Record and the 19-year-old lifeguard begged not to be locked up in hospital . 
But last night, Ruth’s mum confirmed her daughter had been detained by police and was being monitored round-the-clock in a psychiatric ward at Parkhead Hospital in Glasgow.
Eileen, 55, said: “Please help us. Ruth is being held and if she stays there she’ll die, I’m sure of that.
 “My solicitor can’t do anything and Ruth will be in hospital for at least 72 hours, when they  will review her situation. I know her weight is going to drop dramatically but it’s her spirits I’m worried about.” 
In a text message from her hospital bed, Ruth pled: “Mum, please get me out.”
Her dad Brian, 64, yesterday wrote to Health Secretary Alex Neil to raise his daughter’s plight.
In his letter, he said: “I fully accept you cannot get involved in clinical decisions but if she is kept in, there is great risk to her physical and mental health.
“She needs her job and freedom to keep her healthy and sane.”

Retired teacher Eileen and Brian, a helper for people with special needs, have fought a long battle with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over their daughter’s welfare.
Eileen said: “We’ve been fighting the system for years. These people have my daughter’s life in their hands and I want her freed.
“She’s going to die. It’s torture, I’m climbing the walls.”
Ruth, of Riddrie, Glasgow, has been living with anorexia since the death of her grandad Archie three years ago and has endured two previous traumatic spells detained on psychiatric wards.
 But her parents said she had turned her life around, was living independently and holding down  a job – and they believe she should get treated as an outpatient. 
Brian has also been in touch with Aberdeenshire West MSP Dennis Robertson, whose 18-year-old daughter Caroline died from anorexia in 2011.
The SNP politician has campaigned for greater awareness among medical professionals to enable sufferers to be diagnosed and treated earlier.
He said: “I’m working closely with the Scottish Government on how we develop the most appropriate care for people with eating disorders.
“I do realise that this is a very complex area and I will continue to support everyone involved in taking this forward.”
An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokeswoman said: “Our staff have spoken to the family and reassured them that, in our view, detaining their daughter is the best course of action for her welfare.
“Our first priority is Ruth’s physical and mental wellbeing and we believe this can only be achieved in hospital at this moment in time.
“We have also indicated to the family our desire to work with them in the best interests of Ruth.”
The Scottish Government said: “While clinicians must always take decisions in the best interest of the patient, this is clearly a difficult situation and we hope the board can work with the family to find the best possible solution.”
CHARITIES yesterday called for specialised wards to treat troubled teenagers battling mental health problems such as anorexia.
It came after the Record raised the case of Ruth Geddes, who was initially treated in an adolescent ward in Glasgow’s Stobhill Hospital but was transferred to an adult unit at Parkhead when she turned 18.
Paula Lavis, who is a co-ordinator at the Mental Health Foundation’s Children and Young People’s Coalition, said: “We hear of young people’s experiences in adult wards – it’s very frightening and is very untherapeutic.
“It can be so frightening, especially if you don’t think you should be there and you are reasonably well.
“Being in that sort of environment can be unhealthy and they need to have some hope they will recover.”
Susan Ringwood, chief executive of eating disorder charity Beat, said: “What’s unusual and more challenging about an eating disorder is that it is the physical consequences of the illness that can be so dangerous.
“Sometimes if someone is at very low weight or their physical health has been affected by their eating disorder a hospital is really the only safe place for them to be.
“But, even so, they still need to be treated by someone with expertise in treating the mental side of the eating disorder.
“The one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t always work and if their health is compromised then they do need the medical support that they can only have in a hospital setting.
“This illness can be fatal in too many cases and people can be living on a knife edge and they might not realise how at risk their life can be.”###
9|||A NEW £50million bridge over the River Clyde connecting two communities is being planned by council bosses. £50m City Deal bid to build new Clyde bridge at Yoker A NEW £50million bridge over the River Clyde connecting two communities is being planned by council bosses.The road bridge would link Yoker, in the West of Glasgow, to Renfrew.The project, which is being led by Renfrewshire Council, is likely to begin in 2018 or 2019.Once complete, the bridge will provide residents with quicker access to Braehead shopping mall and Glasgow Airport.The bridge will be able to open to let vessels pass up and down the river.Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said it would be a &quot;spectacular sight&quot; when it is built.The project is part of the &pound;1.13billion City Deal for the Glasgow region, which will see the UK and Scottish Governments each give &pound;500m of extra investment.The councils in the region will supplement this by borrowing &pound;130m.The money is being used to pay for major infrastructure and roads projects in a bid to boost the area's economy by &pound;2.4bn annually.Mr Macmillan said: &quot;Renfrewshire is at the forefront of the &pound;1.13bn City Deal programme, with projects to develop the long-awaited rail link to Glasgow Airport and further development at Clyde Waterfront/Renfrew Riverside.&quot;A road bridge connecting Renfrew and Yoker is another key project which will bring benefits to communities on both sides of the Clyde.&quot;The bridge will support further private sector investment and job creation, with improved access to investment opportunities at Glasgow Airport and Inchinnan Business Park.&quot;He said the cost is likely to be &quot;in the region of &pound;50m with a potential start date of 2018 or 2019.&quot;He added: &quot;Obviously, things are at an early stage but it is likely that the design and engineering solution will need to accommodate some form of opening or moveable structure so that navigation can continue on the river.&quot;That should make for a spectacular sight once the bridge is in place.&quot;However, the project leaves a question mark over the future of the Renfrew Ferry.There is also uncertainty over the future of the planned Yoker Relief Road, which has attracted local opposition.Garscadden/Scotstounhill councillor Graeme Hendry said he thought the relief road was going ahead as part of the City Deal.The road, which would run from Yoker to Clydebank, to take the pressure off Dumbarton Road, has been in Glasgow's planning books for decades but has not moved forward.Mr Hendry said Yoker residents contacted him a year ago because they had received a planning application from the council regarding the road.However, it turned out the council was not planning anything and the letter was just part of a routine process to keep the application active.Mr Hendry said: &quot;It's causing confusion.&quot;The council needs to drop the road if they're not interested it in anymore and explore the possibilities in delivering other plans.&quot;Yoker is an area which could benefit from easier access to Braehead.&quot;I can see the logic in the bridge.&quot;Mr Hendry called on bosses to carry out an economic analysis of what it could bring to each area.He said: &quot;We seem to have a wish list and the cash there, but no concrete plans on taking things forward.&quot;rachel.loxton@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

Police won't take arms on routine jobs vows top cop ARMED police will now only be deployed to life-threatening incidents or those involving firearms, following a review by the Chief Constable.Sir Stephen House has decided that his 275 officers attached to armed response vehicles will retain their standing authority to carry guns but that they will be not be dispatched to routine incidents.There were 2,805 firearms deployments across Scotland between April 1 and August 31 - the equivalent of more than 150 a day, Police Scotland said.Some politicians and members of the public have raised concerns about armed officers attending incidents such as road accidents and petty crimes.Sir Stephen has approved the recommendation of the Armed Policing Monitoring Group (APMG) that the national standing firearms authority be continued, but officers attached to armed response vehicles will now only be deployed to firearms incidents or where there is a threat to life.Armed officers will still have discretion to intervene if they see a crime in progress while in the course of their duties.The Chief Constable's decision &quot;took into consideration the concerns voiced by politicians and some members of the public&quot;, Police Scotland said.A working group has been established to decide whether the carriage of firearms and tasers should be &quot;overt or covert&quot; - whether they will carried on display or concealed.The group will submit a preliminary report to the next meeting of the APMG in January 2015.Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said: &quot;We have balanced our overriding duty to keep people safe with consideration of the views expressed about the perception of armed officers supporting local policing activities.&quot;Having a small number of armed police officers available means we can retain our operational flexibility.&quot;###

Wonga to write off debts for 330,000 customers Wonga is to write off the debts of 330,000 customers after it admitted it has made loans to people who could not afford to repay them.The move by the pay-day lender comes after an agreement with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that requires it to make significant changes to its business immediately.The review means that about 330,000 customers who are currently in excess of 30 days in arrears will have the balance of their loan written off and will owe Wonga nothing.Approximately 45,000 customers who are up to 29 days in arrears will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges and will be given an option of paying off their debt over an extended period of four months.Wonga's new chairman Andy Haste said: &quot;We want to ensure we only lend to those who can reasonably afford the loan in question and during my review, it became clear to me that this has unfortunately not always been the case.&quot;I agreed with the concerns expressed by the FCA and as a consequence of our discussions we have committed to taking these actions.&quot;###

Glasgow medics bring hope to indian amputees LEPROSY survivors, young people who have been involved in road accidents and diabetes patients are just some of the people whose lives are transformed each day after a visit to the Mukti Clinic.Set up in the centre of India's chaotic and bustling city of Chennai, it not only gives hope to amputees, it offers a vital opportunity to train local staff as well as students from Glasgow.Each year a group of fourth-year students from the National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University of Strathclyde's department of biomedical engineering make a trip to the clinic to share expertise and learn the job first-hand.They come back to Scotland with a wealth of knowledge to take them through the final months of their degree.&quot;When the students are in Mukti they are working very hard, in a very different atmosphere to the NHS,&quot; said lecturer Dr Anthony McGarry.&quot;The majority of people will have amputations below or above the knee.&quot;Many are linked to diabetes - India, with its population of more than 1.2 billion, has one of the highest rates of diabetes in the world and it tends to affect people who are sedentary, obese and over 60.&quot;The other group of patients with amputations have been involved in road traffic accidents - many are young men aged between 20 and 30.&quot;There are wonderful medical services available in India if you have money.&quot;If you come from a poorer or less well-educated background it is also possible that you can fall through the net: you can have an amputation and no-one gives you a prosthesis.&quot;The Mukti project was set up by the University of Strathclyde in 2011 to provide instruction and assist in clinical treatment.Mukti means freedom in Hindi and the charity's slogan is: &quot;Freedom from crutches.&quot;Students and alumni raise funds and a group of six students, accompanied by two members of staff, travel to Chennai every year to visit the clinic.In preparation for the next trip east in January, fundraising is already is full swing.Students have organised ceilidhs, run marathons and one has raised more than &pound;1000 after completing the Three Peaks Challenge, climbing the highest mountains in Scotland, England and Wales within 24 hours.The relationship between the clinic and the university goes on all year, with regular Skype calls to help local staff in Chennai deal with problems as they arise.&quot;The biomedical engineering centre at the university and the National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics which is within it is one of the best schools in the world,&quot; explains Anthony.&quot;Many of the different standards of practice have been based on our model of teaching.&quot;Because Mukti is a new project we have started off by working alongside their clinicians - they don't really have any formal education in prosthetics and orthotics so what we're trying to establish is, what do they need to improve their practice?&quot;We're also identifying the gaps in the practice that we would consider needs to be altered or improved.&quot;Money raised by the university's alumni association has this year bought an important piece of machinery that allows staff in India to produce prosthetic feet on site.They cost just $4 to make and are produced from recycled rubber and tyres.&quot;Mukti are doing a great job with the limited resources they have. Buying them that piece of equipment has enabled us to establish a level trust with them,&quot; says Anthony.Lady Eileen McDonald, university principal Sir Jim McDonald's wife, is the ambassador of the project and has travelled to India to visit the clinic.&quot;The work that is carried on at the clinic is nothing short of amazing,&quot; she says.&quot;The charity provides prostheses and orthoses free of charge and, although priority is given to children and young people, no-one is turned away.&quot;The positive impact the clinic has on life and the life opportunities of those that benefit from the provision of prosthetic limbs is quite uplifting.&quot;Through the university's relationship with Mukti, great opportunities are provided for our students to work in different cultures and with different technologies that can really make a difference.&quot;n To donate to the project, visit www.alumni.strath.ac.uk/donate.angela.mcmanus @eveningtimes.co.uk###

Public quizzed in search for Arcade robbers DOZENS of motorists and pedestrians were quizzed by detectives hunting armed robbers behind a £230,000 designer watch heist.One week after a gang of axe-wielding raiders smashed into Glasgow's Argyll Arcade, police returned to the scene where a suspected get-away car was dumped.Uniform and plain-clothed officers stopped and interviewed motorists and pedestrians in Townhead yesterday afternoon in a bid to glean vital clues.The four balaclava-clad men, armed with sledgehammers and axes, took just 54 seconds to smash open window display cases at Argyll Arcade and escape with the haul of top-of-the-range watches.Stunned shoppers watched in terror as the armed thugs staged a brazen raid on jewellery shops off Buchanan Street last Wednesday lunchtime.Today officers pulled over motorists and stopped pedestrians in the Castle Street area, near Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where the white Volkswagen Golf - believed to have been used by the thieves - was abandoned.Police revealed the car had been stolen from outside a house in Haddington, East Lothian just hours before the raid.After dumping the getaway car, it is thought the gang headed towards Edinburgh in a Vauxhall Combo van.Detective Inspector Alasdair Barlow, said: &quot;We now know that the men involved had access to a white Volkswagen Golf hatchback which they used to get away from the scene of the crime.&quot;Witness reports say that they drove at excessive speed from Queen Street, up Ingram Street and up to High Street, often driving on the wrong side of the road.&quot;However, we also know that they had access to a Vauxhall Combo van.&quot;It is known at this time that they abandoned the Volkswagen in Castle Street shortly after the robbery and then left in the Vauxhall van, which was last seen driving onto the M8 towards Edinburgh.rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
21|||UPDATED plans for the £104million transformation of Glasgow Queen Street station have been published. Queen Street revamp taking shape UPDATED plans for the £104million transformation of Glasgow Queen Street station have been published.Additional bike stands and widened passenger stairs at the station's George Square entrance are among the changes unveiled by Network Rail following a public consultation which ran until May.The station is Scot-land's third busiest and known as the &quot;gateway to the Highlands&quot;.The overhaul, which is scheduled to run from next year until 2019, will replace the current 1970s entrance and the hotel extension above with a huge 500sq m modern glass facade intended to turn the station into a George Square landmark.Its completion will mark the final stage of the Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Prog-ramme (Egip), which has already delivered a &pound;25m new-look Haymarket station in Edinburgh and is rolling out electrific-ation across Central Belt routes to cut the shortest journey times between the cities from 48 minutes to 42 min-utes and boost capacity.Original plans were published in February.As a result of feedback, the main access ramp will now be located in the building rather than outside with access to the lower level platforms at the east side of the station improved by moving the lifts closer to the stairs.A study is also under way to assess other measures which could improve access to the lower level platforms.Plans for a footbridge inside the station have been axed and there are also slight changes to the glass facade and the shape of the roof, which will be flatter at the west side.Artists' impressions reveal what the revamped station will look like inside when the public floorspace is doubled, with changes to ticket gate lines creating more space for passengers on the concourse.

Dog walker 'found underwear' A DOG walker told a court he found a gun, a mobile phone and two bin bags full of women's underwear at a disused quarry.James McIlduff, 30, said that he also discovered a piece of cardboard with duct tape on it and a large jacket.He was giving evidence at the trial of Thomas Feeney, 47, who denies robbing and sexually assaulting, with intent to rape, a 33-year-old woman at a property near Shotts, North Lanarkshire, on September 5 last year.It is alleged that Feeney tied the woman up with duct tape and robbed her of &pound;2000, car keys, a BMW 3 series car and underwear.Feeney also denies a firearms offence by using an imitation gun with intent to cause the woman to believe unlawful violence would be used against her.Mr McIlduff told the High Court in Glasgow that he was walking at the quarry sometime after Christmas time last year when he saw the items.He said: &quot;I saw stuff scattered around.&quot;It didn't look as if it had been there long.&quot;There were two bags of underwear - a lot of it still had tags on.&quot;I thought someone had stolen them from a shop.&quot;The court heard that Mr McIlduff did not report this find to the police.But weeks later while working in Shetland, he saw a reconstruction of the incident on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and told a friend of the 33-year-old woman what he had seen at the disused quarry on a back road near Clarkston.The trial before Judge Norman Ritchie QC continues.###

38|||A RESCUE bid to revive the fortunes of one of Scotland’s most historic cinema buildings has received a major cash boost, just weeks after the landmark was forced to close its doors Historic Picture House cinema in Campbeltown saved 
  
A RESCUE bid to revive the fortunes of one of Scotland’s most historic cinema buildings has received a major cash boost, just weeks after the landmark was forced to close its doors.

Arts agency Creative Scotland has agreed to plough money into the Picture House in Campbeltown in a bid to get the 101-year-old cinema up and running again.
It has agreed to provide &pound;400,000 towards a planned restoration of the art deco structure and creation of a second screen, cafe-bar and new foyer.
The A-listed Picture House was the longest-running cinema in Scotland until it closed last month, with the community group which owns it blaming the amount of improvement work needed to make it commercially viable.
The famous Argyll cinema was placed into voluntary liquidation but its parent company, Campbeltown Community Business Limited, has insisted it is planning to press on with plans for a full overhaul of the site.
Plans to breathe new life into the Picture House have been mooted for years, but the costs have risen from about &pound;1.7 million in 2010 to more than &pound;3m.
However, the community trust, formed in 1987 to secure its future, insists it is still on track to get building work under way next year, with a target of reopening by the end of 2016.
A taskforce was formed at the beginning of last year in a bid to secure the long-term future of the cinema, ahead of its 100th anniversary. Historic Scotland has already pledged almost half a million pounds for the project, while the Heritage Lottery Fund has ringfenced more than &pound;800,000. Creative Scotland said its grant would “recognise and maintain the historic nature of the A-listed auditorium, protecting its cultural heritage whilst enabling the cinema to increase the diversity of programming”.
Jane Mayo, chair of Campbeltown Community Business Limited, said: “The redeveloped Picture House will provide the community and visitors with a magnificent historic cinema equipped to modern standards complemented by new facilities. 
“The programme of films and live relays of international quality cultural performances, together with activities based on the heritage of the building and the evolution of cinema, will allow the Picture House truly to become Kintyre’s cultural and entertainment hub.”
Ms Mayo said the trust was expecting further funding decisions from various bodies, trusts and foundations this year.
She added: “Detailed design work and tendering will take place between January and July next year, with work on-site starting in September 2015. The complete restoration and redevelopment is scheduled for completion by December 2016.”
Meanwhile, a long-awaited new centre for children’s literature, earmarked for the childhood home of Peter Pan creator JM Barrie, has been awarded almost &pound;700,000.
The restoration plan for Moat Brae House in Dumfries, where the author lived between the ages of 13 and 18, would see the property become a flagship attraction for the town, including an adventure garden in the grounds where Barrie played.
The fundraising campaign was launched three years ago by actress Joanna Lumley, patron of the &pound;4.5m project, due for completion in 2016.###
39|||THE parents of a teenager with anorexia have pleaded for their daughter to be freed after she was placed in a mental health  facility by doctors ‘Free my anorexic girl from mental health ward’ 
  
THE parents of a teenager with anorexia have pleaded for their daughter to be freed after she was placed in a mental health  facility by doctors.

Ruth Geddes, 19, and her parents went on the run from their home in Riddrie, Glasgow, on Tuesday to avoid her being taken into care after her GP sectioned her under the Mental Health Act as an emergency, fearing her life was at risk because of her eating disorder.
Brian and Eilleen Geddes said their daughter – who has been sectioned twice before – was not at risk. They said that she had been living in her own flat, holding down a job and that her health had improved.
The parents want their daughter treated as an outpatient, as they fear that being in hospital could be so traumatic it would damage her health, and even put her life at risk.
Mr Geddes, 64, a helper for people with special needs, said: “Until Monday, my daughter was happy at work and eating well. If she goes into hospital, she will die there. She’ll lose her job and her flat and refuse to eat. When she was in last time, she went on hunger strike. They had to feed her with a tube.
“If she was in the situation she was in previously, I’d happily say she can go back to hospital. But she’s doing well and this will ruin her life.
“Our relationship with the NHS has completely broken down. They’re more interested in covering their own backs.”
Ms Geddes was diagnosed with anorexia in 2011, thought to have been triggered when her grandfather died. Having been sectioned, she spent five months on the ward for adolescent patients at Stobhill Hospital. She had a second stay in hospital for three months at the end of 2012.
Ms Geddes said on Tuesday, before being admitted to the mental health facility: “I’m not denying I have an eating disorder. But I’m not insane. 
“I’ll die if they put me in a psychiatric hospital. I’ve been sectioned before and every night it gives me nightmares.”
She said during her times in hospital she had witnessed people self-harming and pacing the corridors “shouting at people who aren’t there”.
She added: “I’ve never been this healthy and they want to section me.”
Mr Geddes said he had fought to have her released after she was sectioned the second time, winning two tribunal cases.
On Tuesday, having attempted to avoid handing their daughter over by staying in a hotel, Mr and Mrs Geddes were persuaded to do so after Mr Geddes had returned to their home and seen police officers waiting. Ruth was said to have gone with the officers under her own volition.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “Our staff have spoken to the family and reassured them that, in our view, detaining their daughter is the best course of action for her welfare.
“Our first priority is the physical and mental wellbeing of their daughter and we believe this can only be achieved in hospital at this moment in time.”
The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 sets out the process by which someone can be sectioned.###

43|||RUTH GEDDES is being held under the Mental Health Act because doctors fear her eating disorder is putting her life at risk. Anorexic teenager makes desperate plea to be allowed to leave hospital ward where she is being held - Daily Record AN anorexic teenager has made a heartbreaking plea for freedom from the hospital ward where she is being detained.
Ruth Geddes penned a personal letter to the Daily Record after she was locked up by psychiatrists under the Mental Health Act.
Medics at Auchinlea Health Centre claim the 19-year-old’s eating disorder is putting her life at risk because her blood sugar level has dropped dangerously low.
She now faces at least 28 days in Parkhead Hospital’s psychiatric ward despite her parents saying it is derailing her rehabilitation from previous stints ofanorexia.
Ruth’s parents, Brian, 64, and Eileen, 55, insist their daughter’s health had improved and she is coping with her anorexia.
But they claim her life will spiral out of control and she will lose her job and home due to be being forced into hospital again - after a horrific experience during two previous hospital stays.
In a message from her hospital bed, Ruth, from Riddrie, Glasgow, has given an insight into life on the ward.
It comes as the lifeguard’s friends set-up an online petition which aims to secure her release from hospital.
Ruth, once a promising swimmer, wrote: “I wish I was as ill as they are saying so that I wouldn’t understand what was happening around me.
“The fact that I am completely functioning and aware makes this hospital worse. Anorexic people have a mental illness but are still mentally intelligent.
“I am not a criminal, nor am I an animal, yet I am in a situation that is just like being locked behind bars. I have flesh, bones, two arms, two legs.
“I could go on but my description surely makes that of a human being or would that be an irrational conclusion?
“I also have a brain would you believe? An actual brain that functions. It allows me to put one foot in front of the other so I am also positive that means I have a working brain.
“I think that would be another rational conclusion?&nbsp;
“So why am I standing behind a window watching an open space filled with things like me?”
Specialists yesterday highlighted the difficulties facing troubled teenagers who are admitted to mental health wards.
An online petition was launched after the Daily Record revealed that Ruth and her parents went into hiding because a detention order had been issued.
Already more than 200 people have signed up to the forum, which states: “Ruth was on the clear road to recovery from an eating disorder when the authorities decided to put her back inside, along with the psychotic patients.”
Retired teacher Eileen, who lives in Springhill, Glasgow, said: “We are in a desperate situation. We are just trying to save her life.”###
44|||Publisher of the Herald, Sunday Herald and Evening Times has also outlined plans to cut a further 12 newsroom jobs as it implements new publishing software and centralises its Glasgow-based journalism. Newsquest (Herald and Times) Ltd reports 23% drop in pre-tax profits Newsquest (Herald and Times) Ltd reports 23% drop in pre-tax profits - Daily Record Newsquest (Herald and Times) Ltd has reported a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to &pound;9.2 million for the 2013 year.
The group, which published the Herald, Sunday Herald and Evening Times, has announced plans to shed a further 12 newsroom jobs in a move linked to a new editorial software roll out and centralisation of its Glasgow-based journalism.
Managing director Tim Blott said editorial decisions and budget control will continue to be managed from the Glasgow office.
He said: &quot;We are committed to giving our readers the best possible service of unique and compelling content, whether online or in print.”
In accounts filed with Companies House for the 2013 year to December 29, the group reports turnover dipped 5.7 per cent to &pound;53.7 million with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITA) was down 17.8 per cent to &pound;12.07 million (2012; &pound;14.69 million).
Pre-tax profits were to &pound;9.2 million against &pound;12 million the previous year as earning margins dipped to 22.5 per cent from 25.8 per cent reported in 2012.
The group, which published the Herald, Sunday Herald and Evening Times, has booked a tax charge of &pound;12.2 million for the year (2012: nil), which “reflects the fact that the company is paying its ultimate parent undertaking Gannett UK Ltd for group relief for the current and prior year”.
As a result, the group has booked an after tax loss of &pound;2.16 million against an after tax profit of &pound;12.7 million in 2012.
Newsquest said it had “continued to make a series of cost reductions and restructured processes to mitigate the impact of weak revenues” which it said was reflected in “the maintenance of the margin”.
Operating costs rose slightly against the previous year to &pound;35.39 million (2012; &pound;34.49 million) which included &pound;538,000 in restructuring costs and a 2.4 per cent rise in administrative costs to &pound;29.57 million.
Sales and distribution costs were down slightly on 2012 at &pound;5.28 million (2012: &pound;5.49 million).
Staff numbers were down by 24 on the previous year to 477, with editorial staff down from 196 in 2012 to 182 at the 2013 year end.
The Herald and Times titles in Glasgow have today outlined plans to shed 12 of a reported 160 newsroom jobs.
Blott said its Glasgow-based advertising website, s1 will be taking on 18 more staff.
&quot;Our digital subscriptions and online audiences for our news web sites and apps are at record levels,&quot; he said.
&quot;We believe strongly in the future of Scottish journalism.&quot;

Balloch couple face "traumatic" ordeal after armed men turn up at their home A COUPLE were terrorised in their own home after being targeted by armed men.At around 11pm on Tuesday a 56-year-old woman was faced with a man carrying a gun after she answered the door to her Balloch home.The man forced his way into the home in Buchanan Avenue, Haldane, knocking the woman over in the process.Her 63-year-old husband, who had been upstairs, came down and was confronted by the armed man and his accomplice who had also entered their house.A struggle took place and the man also fell.Both suspects fled the house empty handed.

49|||A new £50 million bridge has been proposed across the River Clyde in Glasgow New bridge planned across the River Clyde A new &pound;50 million bridge has been proposed across the River Clyde in Glasgow.

The road bridge would link Yoker, in the west of the city, with Renfrew and will slash travel times to Glasgow Airport.
Renfrewshire Council is leading the multimillion pound project, which is expected to begin in 2018 or 2019.
The bridge will open to let vessels pass up and down the river.
Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said it would be a “spectacular sight” when it is built.
The bridge will be paid for by City Deal cash, which was finalised in August and involves Westminster and Holyrood giving &pound;500 million of extra grant funding to the Glasgow region, following in the footsteps of similar deals for Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool.
The councils in the region are contributing &pound;130 million to the city deal.
Mr Macmillan said: “Renfrewshire is at the forefront of the &pound;1.13 billion City Deal programme, with projects to develop the long-awaited rail link to Glasgow Airport and further development at Clyde Waterfront/Renfrew Riverside.
“A road bridge connecting Renfrew and Yoker is another key project which will bring benefits to communities on both sides of the Clyde.
“The bridge will support further private sector investment and job creation, with improved access to investment opportunities at Glasgow Airport and Inchinnan Business Park.”
He said the cost is likely to be “in the region of &pound;50 million with a potential start date of 2018 or 2019.”
He added: “Obviously, things are at an early stage but it is likely that the design and engineering solution will need to accommodate some form of opening or moveable structure so that navigation can continue on the river.
“That should make for a spectacular sight once the bridge is in place.”

50|||A man was arrested after being caught on video wrestling with police before flooring one and running off in handcuffs along a train station platform Video: handcuffed man makes freedom bid A man was arrested after being caught on video wrestling with police before flooring one and running off in handcuffs along a train station platform.

Martin Crawford, 24, was restrained by a policewoman while he hurled obscentities at her male colleague. 
Despite being handcuffed behind his back, Crawford then shrugs the male officer to the ground before escaping along the platform with the cops in hot pursuit.
Ryan Leitch, 15, from Glasgow, witnessed the dramatic scene unfold at Clydebank train station and recorded it on his mobile phone. The short recording has now being shared almost 7,000 times on Facebook.
Ryan said: “I was at the train station and went to see why the police were there. I saw what was happening and took a video because it was quite funny.
“The guy was swearing at the cop. The other guy in the black top is his friend. I don’t know them.
“I put the video up just two minutes after it happened and now a lot of people have seen it.”
The video ends with the officer getting to his feet and chasing down the handcuffed thug down the platform.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “We can confirm that at 14.00 on 30 August 2014 two males, aged 24 and 25, were arrested for various offences including drinking in public and resisting arrest.”
Both men appeared at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
Crawford received an 80-hour community payback order after he was found guilty of breaching the peace and resisting arrest charges.
Ryan Allan, 25, walked free after pleading not guilty to breaching the peace, obstructing police officers and drinking in public.

51|||A RESCUE bid to revive the fortunes of one of Scotland’s most historic cinema buildings has received a major cash boost, just weeks after the landmark was forced to close its doors Lifeline for Picture House cinema in Campbeltown 
  
A RESCUE bid to revive the fortunes of one of Scotland’s most historic cinema buildings has received a major cash boost, just weeks after the landmark was forced to close its doors.

Arts agency Creative Scotland has agreed to plough money into the Picture House in Campbeltown in a bid to get the 101-year-old cinema up and running again.
It has agreed to provide &pound;400,000 towards a planned restoration of the art deco structure and creation of a second screen, cafe-bar and new foyer.
The A-listed Picture House was the longest-running cinema in Scotland until it closed last month, with the community group which owns it blaming the amount of improvement work needed to make it commercially viable.
The famous Argyll cinema was placed into voluntary liquidation but its parent company, Campbeltown Community Business Limited, has insisted it is planning to press on with plans for a full overhaul of the site.
Plans to breathe new life into the Picture House have been mooted for years, but the costs have risen from about &pound;1.7 million in 2010 to more than &pound;3m.
However, the community trust, formed in 1987 to secure its future, insists it is still on track to get building work under way next year, with a target of reopening by the end of 2016.
A taskforce was formed at the beginning of last year in a bid to secure the long-term future of the cinema, ahead of its 100th anniversary. Historic Scotland has already pledged almost half a million pounds for the project, while the Heritage Lottery Fund has ringfenced more than &pound;800,000. Creative Scotland said its grant would “recognise and maintain the historic nature of the A-listed auditorium, protecting its cultural heritage whilst enabling the cinema to increase the diversity of programming”.
Jane Mayo, chair of Campbeltown Community Business Limited, said: “The redeveloped Picture House will provide the community and visitors with a magnificent historic cinema equipped to modern standards complemented by new facilities. 
“The programme of films and live relays of international quality cultural performances, together with activities based on the heritage of the building and the evolution of cinema, will allow the Picture House truly to become Kintyre’s cultural and entertainment hub.”
Ms Mayo said the trust was expecting further funding decisions from various bodies, trusts and foundations this year.
She added: “Detailed design work and tendering will take place between January and July next year, with work on-site starting in September 2015. The complete restoration and redevelopment is scheduled for completion by December 2016.”
Meanwhile, a long-awaited new centre for children’s literature, earmarked for the childhood home of Peter Pan creator JM Barrie, has been awarded almost &pound;700,000.
The restoration plan for Moat Brae House in Dumfries, where the author lived between the ages of 13 and 18, would see the property become a flagship attraction for the town, including an adventure garden in the grounds where Barrie played.
The fundraising campaign was launched three years ago by actress Joanna Lumley, patron of the &pound;4.5m project, due for completion in 2016.###
52|||RAUNCHY footwear - on sale in Edinburgh yesterday - sparks furious reaction from parents and MSP. Shoe chain under fire for selling boots with design showing couple having sex - Daily Record A SHOE chain came under fire yesterday for selling boots with a design showing a couple having sex.
The &pound;175 trainers from Spanish brand Camper, who have shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow, sparked a furious reaction from parents and an MSP.
The Himalayan ankle boots by German designer Bernhard Willhelm are available from a size two – small enough for a child.
They were on sale in store in Edinburgh and online yesterday and are described as combining the designer’s “love of provocation” with Camper’s “free-spirited attitude”.
One 39-year-old mum, from Perthshire, who asked not to be named, said: “The pictures are exceptionally graphic.
“I’d worry I’d be arrested for wearing them but imagine if someone leaves them lying around and a child sees them.”
Tory MSP Liz Smith added: “I do not consider this an appropriate marketing tool if the shoes are likely to be sold to young people. I think there will be lots of parents concerned about the message this sends out.”
Camper UK’s Ruth Coughlan said: “The Himalayan shoe is a niche collection and includes the designer’s artistic expression. They are available for adults only.”###
53|||FIFTY Shades of Grey said golf tourney was respite from his hectic schedule of film and TV work. Lack of sleep and Bill Murray's jokes tested actor Jamie Dornan's game in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship - Daily Record FIFTY Shades Of Grey Star Jamie Dornan might be giving ladies around the world hot flushes but the strapping actor used to be found sweating it out on the dancefloor of a Scots nightclub.
Jamie, who plays erotic billionaire Christian Grey in the forthcoming movie of the best selling book, was in Scotland to play the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and revealed that he used to be a regular at The Glasgow Garage club and student unions.
 

Coming off the 18th hole at Carnoustie he said: &quot;I've&nbsp; done my time in Scotland. I spent a lot of time here with student friends. They were all in Glasgow so I had many a fun night in Glasgow. It's been a while now, probably about ten years ago, but we'd go to The Garage. That was one of the clubs and the students union was always a big one. I doubt I was a hit with the Scottish ladies.&quot;
Jamie, whose wife Amelia Warner gave birth to their first child in December, wasn't enamoured with his play on the course, despite his film character's reputation for er, swinging.
 

After joking we'd heard he was good at the sport he replied: &quot;Who did you hear that from? This is my first time playing golf here and it's tricky out there. I'm hoping it's going to get easier but the rain is coming tomorrow so I doubt that. I was here in 1999 when Jean van Delvelde was having fun in the burn there and Paul Laurie took it home. I was 17 years old and stood here on the 18th green watching all this happen.&quot;
The actor who is more brooding than witty, admitted playing golf was bit of respite from his upcoming movie and TV work.
He said: &quot;This week is a bit of a rest. I've got a lot going on and and have a job coming up in a couple of weeks so probably should be doing some work. I have to do a lot of prep cause it's a job like any other. I do slightly more strenuous things to keep fit but you don't get many tubby golfers. I don't know when I'll next be in Scotland but I always enjoy it. The genes are similar, We probably share some similarities -&nbsp;&nbsp; socially on the drink.&quot;
He added: &quot;It's been good fun with Bill Murray. He's a legend with a great swing and he can't stay serious for too long and he was great company. It was jokes all round until I was hitting it so badly I couldn't really stand for jokes anymore. I'm now going to have a pint here or get back to St. Andrews where I'm staying to reflect and try to work out how to play golf tomorrow.&quot;
Bill Murray who couldn't wait to have a bowl of soup with maybe &quot;half a pint of sherry in it&quot; after his round of golf admitted that playing with Jamie wasn't as funny as it could have been.
He said: &quot;Jamie is kind of the strong silent type and our conversations were interspersed like two amateurs kayaking across the ocean heading in separate directions&nbsp;&nbsp; and getting together back at the tee. He had a little more trouble than I had. He started strong and didn't have a lot of sleep. Because of the new baby he's sleep deprived.&quot;
Bill who said he'd been on a boat trip round the Isle of May and talked with the seals also revealed he'd been at George Clooney's wedding but hadn't bought him and his new bride a present.
He said: &quot;It wasn't as momentous for me because I didn't get married although I had a wonderful time and I got moist. They are two wonderful people and very happy. You don't buy them anything as a present. You are asked not to bring anything and asked to leave without anything.&quot;###
54|||THE Glasgow drama club are on the hunt for new members as rehearsals start for their production of the much-loved Broadway classic. Glasgow AmDram: No Channing Tatum or Joseph Gordon-Levitt for Theatre South Productions' Guys and Dolls - Glaswegians have all the star quality we need says director - Daily Record RICHARD WAUGH may struggle to get Channing Tatum or Joseph Gordon-Levitt onboard for Theatre South’s production of Guys and Dolls, but he’s still looking for star talent amongst new recruits.
With the Hollywood duo set to star as Sky Masterson and Nathan Detroit in a film remake of the Broadway classic, director Richard concedes that while they may be too busy to join the south side drama group, there’s plenty of talented Glaswegians who fit the bill.
 The club are putting on the Tony Award winning musical at Eastwood Park theatre in March, and are on the hunt for new members ready to bring fresh life into a show currently undergoing a popular renaissance. 
Clarkston resident Richard said: “Though it would be nice to have Tatum or Gordon-Levitt onboard, we know there’s loads of hugely talented people out there we’d love to have along.
“The show itself is undergoing a revival having just been performed at the Chichester Theatre to huge acclaim, it’s now moving to London’s West End and there’s the new movie, so it’s a show that’s definitely becoming even more popular.
“Not only is it a great chance to be part of what’s already promising to be a brilliant performance, but Theatre South is a fantastic environment to meet new friends.
“New members can expect a great welcome, a lot of fun, a professionally minded show they’ll want their friends and family to see and great social scene.”
It’s not Theatre South Production’s - or Richard’s - first brush with the 1950 classic, famous for its show-stoppers such as Luck Be A Lady, Sit Down You’re Rockin’ The Boat and the famous title track, which was previously brought to the silver screen in 1955 by Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra.
The club staged it in 1997, with Richard playing leading man Sky.

But the 47-year-old is hoping whoever he casts as the hero of the piece won’t be following his example when it comes to the romantic stuff.
He explained: “I’m hoping the person who plays Sky, unlike me, doesn’t drift off on stage thinking about his dinner and forget to catch the leading lady mid-number.
“There’s a scene where Sarah Brown swoons as she was supposed to be drunk, and I was to catch her. I was too busy thinking did I leave the oven on, and she fairly clunked on hitting the floor - I was mortified.
&quot;But this time round we want new members, young or old, male or female, of all talents or none. Don't be scared if you're not the best singer or dancer, we welcome people of all abilities.&quot;
If you’re interested in doing Guys and Dolls, email waugh_ richard@yahoo.co.uk for more information.
Auditions will be held this Sunday, Wednesday and Sunday, October 12.
New members will be considered for principle parts.
Rehearsals take place Wednesdays at 7.30pm at Clarkston Scout Hall.###
55|||MATHEW Edward was key member of gang smuggling in millions of pounds worth of Venezuelan drugs hidden in shipments of fruit. Scots drug-runner jailed for almost seven years for plotting to flood Scotland with cocaine - Daily Record A SCOTS drug-runner has been jailed for plotting to flood the country with high-purity cocaine.
Mathew Edward, 49, was a linchpin in a gang smuggling drugs into the UK hidden in shipments of watermelons and pomegranates.
Kevin Hanley, 52, set up the international trafficking ring after &quot;Mr Big&quot; Brian Wright - known as The Milkman because he always delivered - was brought down by a massive police operation.
Hanley used a wholesale food business in London’s Covent Garden Market as a front for the transportation of Venezuelan cocaine by lorry from southern Europe to the UK.
His new venture was finally broken up in 2012 after a surveillance operation led to the arrest of his gang and the seizure of &pound;2.5million of cocaine and &pound;2million in cash.
But Hanley remained on the run in Greece until July last year when police swooped on an Irish pub in Athens as he watched the British and Irish Lions rugby team beat Australia.
He pleaded guilty to the drug smuggling conspiracy in January but the case could not be reported until now. Hanley was jailed for 17 years and four months.
His two “lieutenants”, Greek TV mogul Chrysi Minadaki, 45, and grocery businessman John Fowler, 58, were jailed for 17 years and 16 years respectively.
As part of the operation, Hanley's henchman Edward - who has three other convictions for supplying drugs at the Glasgow High Court - plotted the distribution of cocaine to Scotland and was jailed for six years and 10 months. His associate Richard Harrison, 58, from Liverpool, was jailed for five years and six months.
In 2013 Edward was jailed for 12 years for conspiracy to supply heroin and Harrison was jailed for nine years for the same offence.
Brian Brendan Wright was the head of the most successful international drug trafficking network before he was jailed for 30 years in 2007.
The smooth talking gambler boasted a celebrity lifestyle, counting the comedian Jim Davidson and the bookmaker Victor Chandler among his horseracing acquaintances.
Police launched a massive investigation into The Wright Organisation after &pound;80million of cocaine was discovered on a yacht near Cork, Ireland, in November 1998.
Judge Wendy Joseph QC told Hanley: “You were known to be at the top of your illegal trade, and were described as a ‘top, top man’. It is you who has drawn everybody together in this web of trafficking.
“It does not need me to spell out the harrowing misery that drug trafficking causes, not least to the victims of other crimes committed in order that drugs are purchased.”
Harrison and Edward, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine earlier this year. Three others were also jailed for their role in the operation.###

The facilities management and project services company, led by Glasgow entrepreneur Sir Willie Haughey, has booked pre-tax profits of &pound;11.39 million for the 2013 ending December, up from &pound;7.42 million in 2012, when pre-tax profits had risen 25 per cent.
The group has also booked &pound;2 million in “exceptional profits” for the year from the disposal “of the intellectual property rights of an internally generated asset”.
City Refrigeration notes in accounts now filed with Companies House, profits after tax rose to just over &pound;9 million for the year, up 80 per cent on &pound;5.04 million in after tax profits booked in 2012.
Stripping out the one-off gain, the company said operating profits increased almost 27 per cent to &pound;9 million.
City Refrigeration has increased its ordinary dividend almost 15 per cent to &pound;8.03 million after having doubled the ordinary dividend in 2012 to &pound;7 million.
A divisional breakdown shows turnover from the facilities management division rose more than 15 per cent &pound;377.2 million and in project services, turnover rose nearly 15 per cent to &pound;81.2 million.
Operating profit in facilities management was up 15 per cent to &pound;12.2 million and was up more than 29 per cent in project services to &pound;2.2 million.
City Refrigeration said the growth in facilities management, which also includes cleaning services, had been “mainly due to successful growth with existing customers in both the UK and Australia”.
Operating margins from the division were also “slightly higher than the previous year, despite continued investment during the year in the establishment of new services and customers”.
In project services, which includes construction services and installation of refrigeration, bakery, security and air conditioning systems, the company notes operating margins had also improved in 2013, and despite continuing pressure in the market, the group said it remains confident “margin levels will be maintained in 2014.
City Refrigeration Holdings employs more than 12,000 people globally. ###

Supporters slam Ashley share deal FANS' groups have strongly criticised billionaire Mike Ashley for strengthening his power base at Rangers without ploughing the £850,000 spent on shares into the crisis-hit club.It was confirmed yesterday that the Newcastle United owner has bought 4.26m in shares from Rangers International Football Club plc, more than doubling his stake, and making him the second biggest stakeholder in the club, behind Isle of Man-based Laxey Partners.The move gives him 8.92% of the &shy;operating company, just short of the 10% dual ownership limit agreed with the Scottish FA.The move has further fuelled speculation that Mr Ashley could take over the Ibrox giants, a belief that did not disappear after Newcastle United said three weeks ago that the Buckinghamshire-born entrepreneur would not sell the Magpies until at least the end of next season.But fans have been outraged that he paid 20p a share through two intermediaries to buy from London-based investment company Hale Hargreaves rather than spend the same amount on RIFC's recent open offer aimed at raising &pound;3.6million.The latter option would have directly &shy;benefited the cash-strapped club's fund-raising effort.The operating company board confirmed last month they had managed to sell 15,667,860 shares to help fund the club, but that was just 667,860 above the minimum threshold that would have seen the &shy;offer collapse and the prospect of a second administration beckoning for the side.It was predicted that the &pound;2.7m the club did manage to raise would barely get it through to Christmas.Mr Ashley said at the time that he would not buy any more shares in the recent open share&shy; &shy;offer to existing stakeholders.The Newcastle owner was unavailable for &shy;comment.###

Council in vow to avoid baby ashes scandal repeat BEREAVED families will never have to suffer the agony of not knowing the location of their child's remains, council bosses have pledged.A Glasgow City Council committee has published its plans to ensure there will be no repeat of the baby ashes scandal.The move comes in the wake of a nationwide inquiry into missing infant and baby remains, led by Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini.Staff at Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh disposed of stillborn and dead babies' remains and told parents there would be no ashes left to scatter following cremation.Glasgow set up an Infant &shy;Cremation Working Group to set down guidelines for the city's two crematoria, Linn and Daldowie.The group has highlighted six areas where improvements have been put in place.At both Glasgow City Council crematoria, ashes are now defined as all that remains following the cremation process, rather than just skeletal remains.As previously told in the Evening Times, hospitals and funeral directors have been told of this change in definition and been advised to ensure bereaved parents are made aware of this.In conjunction with that move, the council now uses baby trays for all infant and baby cremations at both Linn and Daldowie Crematoria.It is hoped this will increase the chance that all ashes are properly collected following the cremation.New processes have been put in place to make sure senior management are thoroughly aware of current cremation documentation used in the &shy;crematoria with the processes reviewed annually.A review of all documentation used by Glasgow City Council crematoria has been carried out with forms and paperwork revised to make sure they can be clearly and easily understood by all cremation applicants.Bereavement management from the council have also met with Funeral Directors and NHS Managers to make sure that those who are dealing with members of the public can properly describe &shy;processes to bereaved parents.Councillor Frank McAveety, convener of the council's Sustainability and the Environment Committee, said: &quot;Glasgow City Council welcomes the Infant Cremation Commission's interpretation of ashes as 'all that remains following the cremation process'.&quot;This provides absolute &shy;clarity for crematoria, funeral directors and hospitals.&quot;Crematoria staff have now been given a clear definition of what should be returned to &shy;bereaved families.&quot;The council, with immediate effect, began to use Dame Elish Angiolini's definition from her report into Mortonhall and moved away from the more general definition of the Federation of Burial and &shy;Cremation Authorities.&quot;This clarification makes it very likely that we will return any ash to bereaved families, where they request it.&quot;The working group is made up of senior officers from Glasgow City Council and chaired by the Executive Director of Land &amp; Environmental Services.###
60|||MAJOR building schemes worth almost £3billion have been approved by Glasgow planners in the past two years. £3bn building bonanza as city celebrates investment MAJOR building schemes worth almost £3billion have been approved by Glasgow planners in the past two years.City leaders say the scale of development indicates the confidence companies have in the city.Much of the success in attracting large scale projects is down to Invest Glasgow, which is made up of a range of organisations including the council, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.Developments include the &pound;842million New South Glasgow Hospitals Campus, the &pound;228m Riverside and City campuses for City of Glasgow College, the &pound;180m Athletes' Village, the &pound;113m Emirates Arena, the &pound;300m extension to Buchanan Galleries, the &pound;220m regeneration of Sighthill, a &pound;200m housing development at Darnley Mains, the &pound;70m St Vincent Plaza office block, and the new &pound;154m recycling centre at Polmadie.Invest Glasgow was set up to promote the city as one of the most business-friendly locations in the UK and Europe.In 2012/2013 the organisation helped the city attract nearly 1000 new jobs in financial and business services, life sciences, engineering, design and manufacturing and low carbon industries.Liz Cameron, the city council's spokeswoman on jobs and the economy, said: &quot;It used to be said you could tell if a city is growing, developing or coming out of recession by counting the cranes across its skyline.&quot;I am glad to say there are a lot of cranes to count in Glasgow right now.&quot;Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said: &quot;UK national figures suggest that investment is slow, that government at all levels has slashed its capital budgets and that large corporations are holding on to their cash.&quot;But one look at this remarkable level of investment over just two years shows that we are bucking the trend.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

62|||SCOTLAND'S top law organisation has called for a major publicity campaign before an opt-out organ donation scheme was introduced. Lawyers in call for publicity on donor opt-out SCOTLAND'S top law organisation has called for a major publicity campaign before an opt-out organ donation scheme was introduced.The Law Society of Scotland has responded to proposals to raise transplant rates, which are backed by the Evening Times.It says a high-profile information campaign is vital to &quot;get it right&quot; before any changes to organ donation legislation.Otherwise, the Society warns, there could be conflict between patients' families and medical staff.The Welsh Government launched a two-year publicity campaign, ahead of the UK's first opt-out system being introduced in December next year.Alison Britton, convener of the Society's Health and Medical Law Committee, said: &quot;The proposed legislation would reverse current law so it is imperative to get it right.&quot;There are issues around individuals who have not opted out or expressed an objection to organ donation, but whose families raise strong objections.&quot;This could lead to clinicians facing the decision to remove organs in the face of strong objection or severe distress of family members.&quot;It is vitally important that appropriate education and training be given to a wide range of people, not only to the medical fraternity, but that a far-reaching and high- profile public campaign is put in place to ensure that any decisions made are fully informed.&quot;Anne McTaggart MSP has put forward proposals to introduce an opt-out organ donation system in Scotland, on the back of the Evening Times's award-winning Opt For Life Campaign.The Organ and Tissue Donation (Scotland) Bill would reverse the current situation and, following the lead of Wales, make it so that people are required to opt-out if they do not want to donate organs after death.Ms McTaggart said: &quot;We know that the role of the family is of real importance in the introduction of a 'soft opt-out' system of organ donation.&quot;The families' view will always be respected and that if they say no, then that is the view taken by the staff.&quot;The Law Society also backs the age for automatic opt-in being set at 16.The proposed legislation is supported by the British Medical Association (BMA).Dr Sue Robertson, member of the BMA's Scottish Council and a renal doctor, said: &quot;We would agree that a high-profile campaign to raise awareness of any change in organ donation legislation would be essential to ensure that the public are fully informed.&quot;The BMA has always maintained that donation should not proceed - even if the legal authority is in place - if it is evident that it would cause severe distress to the relatives.&quot;catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
63|||INSIDE the doors of a food bank that sits tucked away in a quiet street in Glasgow's East End, Lynn Hutt is in tears. We go on the road with the food bank heroes INSIDE the doors of a food bank that sits tucked away in a quiet street in Glasgow's East End, Lynn Hutt is in tears.Lynn, facilities coordinator at Parkhead Nazarene, cannot believe how well stocked the centre is after a delivery from Andrew and Darren Carnegie.The father and son, who have been campaigning to end poverty for years, are able to help out after they drummed up public support.Over the past two weekends, families, community groups and individuals have put their hands in their pockets and brought food and toiletries to the Glasgow's Needy food drive in George Square.They have amassed an astonishing amount of food - from cereals and long-life milk to steak pies and nappies - which will all go to people who cannot afford to put meals on the table.As the Evening Times van rolls up to their storage centre in Tollcross Road, Darren says we won't believe how much food there is.When the shutters of the building - which has been loaned to them by the owners of Ruby Murrys Takeaway - roll up, there are piles of bags filled with thousands of pounds worth of food.&quot;It's unbelievable and overwhelming,&quot; Darren says. &quot;We've been trying to sort it out into different sections but there's just so much. This is what Glasgow people have donated in just two weekends.&quot;Darren says the donations have been &quot;thoughtful&quot;.He says: &quot;I was looking through some of the bags and people have donated really thoughtful meals.&quot;They have remembered about milk or thought to include extras or sweets so they can have a treat.&quot;It means they want people to have a varied diet.&quot;It was nice to see the individual cereal packets meant for kids.&quot;After loading up our lorry with bags of food we move to the first stop - the Parkhead Nazarene.This religious hub has close links with community groups, including Women's Aid and Playbusters, and started providing food packages three years ago for people in need.A university student who was visiting the centre on placement helped to set up a formal food bank and it now helps around 20 families and individuals a week.Coordinator Lynn becomes emotional when she opens the door to the men carrying the food bags.She says: &quot;This helps us so much. This will help the people in the East End who can't afford to eat. I'm in shock that they've come with all this food.&quot;It will go so far - we are so thankful to the people who donated.&quot;Our next stop is the Everlasting Food Bank in Dennistoun.Set up a year ago, it is getting busier all the time. Last month they gave out 108 parcels.Volunteers Mary Halligan and Lewa Thomas help to carry the food donations into the church hall, where they will be sorted.Lewa said: &quot;We rely on church members for a lot of our donations but they are finding it hard too, so this will really help us. We are getting busier every month.&quot;Mary said: &quot;This is absolutely fabulous, we've never seen so many donations in one go.&quot;FOR the last stop we travel into the city centre to visit homelessness charity The Marie Trust.From its base near Central Station it offers services to support homeless people and enable them to change their lives.As part of their service they offer food packages, as well as sleeping bags and extra clothes for people forced to sleep rough. They can be visited by up to 120 people a day.Fundraiser Catherine Lavery is delighted to see the van roll up - she says it's the equivalent of Christmas when they receive extra donations from the public.She says: &quot;Our shelves were almost empty, we were running so low. We were recently given food donations from staff at the Bank of Scotland in Argyle Street but that's nearly gone.&quot;All these shopping bags will give us a really big boost and will help to feed so many people.&quot;It's like Christmas.&quot;With the van empty Andrew and Darren are heading back to their Tollcross home.However, the pair will do another collection on Saturday and they want anyone who can't afford to eat, as well as food banks who want donations, to get in touch.They are also appealing for a permanent van to deliver food.Darren said: &quot;Poverty is a sad reality and we want to do everything we can to end it. But until then Glasgow's Needy will be there to help people.&quot;Anyone who can help should search for Glasgow's Needy on Facebook or tweet @Darrencarnegierachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk###

Ban orders for protest pair TWO men have been handed football banning orders after they were arrested following a protest march in Glasgow.Nicholas Diplacito, 29, and Mark Glancy, 24, were part of a large disturbance before a Celtic and Aberdeen match in March last year.Celtic fans group the Green Brigade had organised a &quot;corteo&quot; procession to back supporters who it felt had been harshly treated by the club and the procurator fiscal following law changes.Around 200 police officers were reportedly deployed to control the 300-strong gathering outside the Chrystal Bell pub in Glasgow's Gallowgate.Police took action after many of those present began protesting on the road - against an agreement that fans could march only on the pavement.Glasgow Sheriff Court heard officers spotted Glancy outside a cordon and &quot;laid hands&quot; on him in a bid to control him.Prosecutor Stephen Ferguson said: &quot;Glancy in an apparent response to this began to behave in an aggressive manner towards the officer.&quot;As Glancy continued to struggle, Diplacito - who did not know him -pulled him from the grip of the police and pushed the officers away.Although he broke free, other offices got hold of Glancy again. He was later found with a &pound;5 ecstasy pill.Diplacito meantime approached two other police officers in a &quot;confrontation manner&quot;.The court heard he yelled &quot;scum, scum, scum&quot; at them leading to him also being arrested.Glancy, of the city's Gorbals, pled guilty to &quot;resisting, obstructing, molesting and hinder-ing&quot; police and possession of ecstasy.Diplacito, of Lanark, admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, struggling with officers and breaking Glancy free from custody as well as a charge of possession of cannabis.The pair were each handed one-year football banning orders. Dipla-cito was told to carry out 135 hours of unpaid work and Glancy fined &pound;630.###

Cycle Aware scheme will put riders in the picture A NEW scheme has been launched to cut the number of cyclists hurt in road accidents.To highlight the campaign, a group of bike fans took their vintage cycles for a spin in George Square.The Cycle Aware scheme, which has been developed by Go Safe Glasgow, focuses on improving road users' perception of hazards.Accessed online, it contains more than 200 narrated film clips, accompanied by 100 multiple choice questions aimed at five different types of road users.People taking the course can choose the role of cyclist, car, taxi, bus or lorry driver.This allows them to take part in a 30-minute interactive course filmed from the perspective of their chosen road user. Manoeuvres unique to each form of transport are included.Frank McAveety, convener of the city council's sustainability and the environment committee, said: &quot;Cycling is one of the most popular participation sports in Glasgow and is firmly established as a major form of commuting.&quot;It's important cyclists and other road users have a clear understanding of their responsibilities on the road and how they respond to the actions of others&quot;The real strength of the Cycle Aware resource lies in the ability to participate and interact in the role of one of the five road users.&quot;It is hoped by highlighting and demonstrating how accidents occur, we can promote a safer shared road space.&quot;Glasgow is progressing well in cutting the number of road casualties.&quot;This couldn't have been achieved without the support and the hard work of staff and partners involved in the promotion and delivery of road safety education.&quot;The Go Safe Glasgow partnership will be promoting the course to cycling organisations, local businesses and the public.&quot;The council's road safety team has a proactive programme in place to visit every business across the city as part of both Cycle Aware and the Drive Safe Its Your Business initiative. &quot;The Cycle Aware road safety training videos can be accessed at www.gosafeglasgow.comGo Safe Glasgow is a partnership of the council, Police Scotland, Strathclyde Safety Camera Partnership, the Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue Service, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Community Safety Glasgow.vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
67|||HE'S on the hunt for Glasgow's hidden treasures. Let's get this show on the road! HE'S on the hunt for Glasgow's hidden treasures.Antique expert Gordon Foster has been involved in the trade for 40 years with his most memorable find coming from the city.Now Gordon is set to cast his eyes over local heirlooms as the Antiques Roadshow heads to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.Gordon said: &quot;We are surprised with something new every time we do the Roadshow but I'm particularly excited about Glasgow for the chance to see silver in the Glasgow style.&quot;With Charles Rennie Mackintosh, at the turn of the 19th century, the style became much more clean and minimalist.&quot;Art really flourished in the city at this time so we don't know what surprises might turn up. I'm very much hoping to see some Celtic style items, particularly from the Iona style of metalwork.&quot;As one of the largest seaports in Britian, valuers from the hit BBC show are looking forward to seeing items from all around the world.They expect to see Kelvingrove flooded with visitors next Thursday when the doors open at 9.30am.The city is also renowned for the Scottish School and the Glasgow School, giving experts the chance to see painting, ceramics, furniture, textiles, jewellery, glass and silver - not to mention the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.Gordon said: &quot;In Glasgow there was a rich merchant class that made its money and had plenty to spend.&quot;Buchanan Street was full of famous jewellers, such as Edwards and Sorleys who made choice items for wealthy customers.&quot;I'm intrigued to see what silver items people have hidden away - from jewellery to tea pots. Even if someone is not sure whether their item has any value or not I would still recommend they bring it along for us to look at.&quot;Gordon's passion for antiques began at a very early age. His mother had an antiques shop in Dunblane and his summers were spent following his parents as they scoured other shops.At the age of 14 he began collecting Wemyss pottery before serving a five-year apprenticeship as an auctioneer in Crieff.An opportunity to join Christie's in Glasgow as a silver specialist arose and Gordon rose through the ranks to become Associate Director then Head of the Silver and Jewellery Department in 1990.In 1998, Gordon set up his own business buying and selling silver.He also advises Scottish museums and institutions on silver and decorative arts.The 50-year-old joined the Antiques Roadshow in 2006 and says anticipating the unexpected is what keeps him interested.His most memorable find is an enamelled brass cross by one of the Glasgow Girls that appeared at a Roadshow in St Andrews in 2011.He said: &quot;It was made for a private family and is a personal religious item so it wasn't of great value but it was a beautiful object, made in the early 20th century and just a real joy to see.&quot;Filming for the 37th series of the show will take place next Thursday. The doors will open at 9.30am and close at 4.30pm and entry is free.Some of Britain's leading antiques and fine arts specialists will be on hand to offer free advice and valuations to visitors.More information can be found at www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums or www.bbc.co.uk/antiquesroadshow###

THE Tories are "relishing" forcing the working poor to pay for the UK budget deficit, the Deputy Prime Minister has said.As the LibDems gather in Glasgow for their annual conference for the second year in a row, Nick Clegg launched an attack on Chancellor George Osborne and the Conservatives, and insisted that Labour's economic policy was &quot;nonsensical &quot;.Mr Clegg hopes to convince people that the Liberal Democrats have made a difference in Government and once people see that, they will recover from the humiliation at the 2011 Holyrood elections.Speaking to the Evening Times, Mr Clegg said he was looking forward to returning to the city where he said he had spent a lot of time in both &quot;joyous and tragic&quot; circumstances in the last year.He was at the Commonwealth Games, but also represented the Government following the Clutha helicopter tragedy.The LibDems will attempt to establish the difference between themselves and the other two parties - with his strongest attack reserved for his Tory coalition partners.He said: &quot;Labour has nothing to say on economy and the Conservatives want to beat up on the poor.&quot;We will borrow less than Labour and cut less than the Conservatives. None of the others can say this.&quot;George Osborne is relishing that the people who will pay the price is the working age poor. We don't accept that.The only people they are asking to make sacrifices are the working age poor.&quot;It is economically illiterate. I don't know how any country can do this sort of deficit reduction.&quot;We have Labour drifting to the nonsensical left and the Conservatives to the socially punitive right.&quot;He was hopeful that the party could reverse its disastrous showing in the 2011 Scottish election, the year after they went into coalition with the Tories and reneged on the leader's no tuition fees pledge.However, Mr Clegg said: &quot;What can go down can go up.&quot;We have had a tough time over the last few years. People will see our basic judgement has been right.&quot;We have delivered huge tax cuts to low and middle earners, expanded apprenticeships and protected pensions.&quot;The more people see that, they will see we made the right choices.&quot;Even if they were not happy we went into coalition, they will accept we did the right thing.&quot;He was adamant that more powers would be delivered to Scotland following the No vote last month.He said: &quot;They will be met in full. We are not going to allow back sliding by the Conservatives. We are the guarantee in Government .&quot;He said it was not dependent upon English votes for English laws.He added: &quot;The Tory leadership is in a blind panic about Ukip. It is a separate debate.&quot;They are absolutely and emphatically not linked to the commitment to give huge swathe of more powers for Scotland.&quot;stewart.paterson@eveningtimes.co.uk###

86|||POLL tax debt totalling more than £100million will be written off in Glasgow following an announcement by Alex Salmond. All poll tax debts to be written off POLL tax debt totalling more than £100million will be written off in Glasgow following an announcement by Alex Salmond.The First Minister revealed plans to legislate to stop councils chasing people for cash still owed more than 20 years after the tax was scrapped.The Scottish Government decided to act after it emerged some councils were considering using the enlarged, post referendum electoral register to track down people who still owed poll tax.The biggest outstanding bill for unpaid poll tax is in Glasgow, where more than one quarter of Scotland's arrears is still owed from the four years when the charge was in place.The council said it has been collecting around &pound;4000 to &pound;5000 a year from previously agreed repayment plans and did not use electoral data to pursue new cases.Although officers have still been pursuing debt, the total amount was written off from the balance sheet years ago and has no impact on the council's budget.Paul Rooney, City Treasurer, said: &quot;As the First Minister knows, we are already years beyond the point at which tracing poll tax arrears ceased to be cost effective - and new electoral data would not have made the slightest bit of difference to that fact.&quot;In Glasgow, we will continue to focus on current collections and breaking the cycle of debt that can hurt households that repeatedly struggle with their Council Tax.&quot;Mr Salmond said the Scottish Government will pass a law meaning councils will no longer be able to collect Poll Tax arrears and will pay some compensation in line with collection rates.He said: &quot;The poll tax was a hated levy, which poured untold misery on communities across Scotland.&quot;It was a hugely discredited tax, even before it was brought in - and it was rightly consigned to history just four years after its introduction.&quot;The electoral register should not be used to collect debts from a defunct tax - something which is even more important given the unprecedented high levels of democratic engagement we have seen recently.&quot;He said collection has fallen from &pound;1.3m a year four years ago to less than &pound;400,000 last year.stewart.paterson@eveningtimes.co.uk###

89|||Camping could be severely restricted in parts of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park under new proposals from the park's board. New Loch Lomond park camping crackdown bylaws proposed Camping could be severely restricted in parts of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park under new proposals from the park's board.
Seasonal bylaws banning unauthorised camping and alcohol were introduced to parts of east Loch Lomond in 2011.
The park's board now want to bring in bylaws at two more areas in response to littering and anti-social behaviour.
The proposals will be put before the park's board next week ahead of a public consultation.
A report which will go before the National Park Authority on Monday details the &quot;resounding success&quot; of the existing bylaw system.
Vandalism and reports of anti-social behaviour are down 81% in the regulated areas.
The report continues that there remain &quot;entrenched problems&quot; at popular loch shore locations in the wider park, which have been left in &quot;a very poor and deteriorating state&quot;.
Anti-social behaviour noted from some visitors includes littering, &quot;cutting down live trees and irresponsible fire lighting&quot;.
Campers who set up caravans and campsites for months on end were also identified as an issue.
In response to this, it is proposed that camping management bylaws be introduced to two new areas, covering many lochs in the Trossachs, much of the west side of Loch Lomond and the north-east tip of Loch Long.
The bylaws, which would make it an offence to camp outside authorised sites without a permit or to cause damage to the area or wildlife, would be accompanied by investment in new facilities.
They would be in effect from 1 March to 31 October each year, applying only to &quot;concentrated areas of entrenched pressures&quot; - which the report notes would cover less than 5% of the park's 720 square miles.
Richard Graham, who runs a tourism business in St Fillians, said the proposals are a &quot;very positive step forward&quot;.
&quot;We'd rather see people educated, but unfortunately I think the people who work here, including park rangers and the police, are fairly powerless to do anything,&quot; he said.
&quot;There needs to be a line over which people can't step.&quot;
However Helen Todd, campaigns manager for Ramblers Scotland, said she was &quot;shocked&quot; by how wide-spread the proposals were.
&quot;I've talked to the park authority and we share the same desires for how to manage these places and I have a lot support for the work they're doing,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I really don't buy the case that they need bylaws to bring these into effect.
&quot;In terms of setting precedents, we've seen it spreading across the park, and I'd imagine there are communities in other parts of Scotland where people will be thinking they need them too. 
&quot;Bit by bit this fantastic access legislation we have is being whittled away.&quot;###
90|||One of Scotland's rarest breeding birds has had its most successful season in at least 45 years, RSPB Scotland has said. Best corncrake season in at least 45 years, says RSPB One of Scotland's rarest breeding birds has had its most successful season in at least 45 years, RSPB Scotland has said.
Surveys for corncrakes recorded 1,289 males between May and July this year - the highest number since counts of the birds began.
Male corncrakes can be detected from the &quot;crex-crex&quot; call that they make.
The RSPB had expected low numbers this year after the species declined by 23% in 2013.
Corncrakes are shy, pigeon-sized birds which breed in Scotland and migrate to Africa in winter. 
They mainly stay hidden among tall vegetation where they can safely raise a family.
Once found across Scotland, numbers of males fell to 400 in the 1990s.
Changes to farming methods, including hay being mowed earlier in the year, were blamed for the decline.
Today, the highest concentrations are recorded on the Hebrides and Orkney.
RSPB Scotland said conservation projects involving crofters and farmers have helped to protect the birds.
The biggest single island population is on Tiree, an island that had 396 calling males this year.###

Robert McKinlay, 50, attacked the women, with whom he was in relationships, at locations in Glasgow.
He was caught when a domestic abuse incident in October 2011 prompted an investigation which uncovered the extent of his abuse.
At Glasgow High Court, McKinlay was told he would serve at least five years in prison.
Det Insp Gillian Patrick, from the Greater Glasgow Domestic Abuse Unit, said: &quot;Robert McKinlay is a serial perpetrator of domestic abuse. 
&quot;He has caused irreversible damage to those in his life across 26 years and we welcome this verdict.&quot;###
92|||Two men who were among 13 people held by police during a march by the Green Brigade group of Celtic fans have been given one year football banning orders. Diplacito and Glancy sentenced over Green Brigade march Two men who were among 13 people held by police during a march by the Green Brigade group of Celtic fans have been given one year football banning orders.
Nicholas Diplacito, 29, from Lanark, and Mark Glancy, 24, from Glasgow, were arrested during the unofficial march in the Gallowgate area on 16 March 2013.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard they behaved in a threatening manner and struggled with police officers.
Diplacito must also carry out 135 hours of unpaid work. Glancy was fined &pound;630.
Stephen Ferguson, football liaison prosecutor for the west of Scotland, said: &quot;These men were part of a disorderly crowd and seemed intent on causing trouble. Such shameful behaviour will not be tolerated. 
&quot;Police officers carrying out their important role in maintaining public order should not be subjected to assault and abuse or hindered and obstructed and we will continue to do all in our power to bring those who perpetrate such crimes to justice.&quot;
Almost 200 officers were deployed to the gathering outside the Chrystal Bell pub in Glasgow's Gallowgate area prior to the Celtic v Aberdeen match last year.
At the time, police said the crowd &quot;appeared to be attempting to stage an illegal street procession and officers were deployed to prevent this&quot;.
The Green Brigade had posted on its website ahead of the protest that it would be holding a &quot;corteo to Celtic Park to raise awareness and show support for the growing list of Celtic supporters receiving and facing bans&quot;. 
It warned those taking part that police would &quot;use every and any excuse to instigate trouble&quot;.###

Dumfries Peter Pan house secures Creative Scotland boost Funding has been secured for plans to create Scotland's first centre for children's literature at a house which helped to inspire the Peter Pan story.
Creative Scotland will give &pound;687,500 towards the project at Moat Brae House in Dumfries.
It has also awarded &pound;400,000 towards the upgrade and restoration of one of the UK's oldest cinemas in Campbeltown.
A further award of more than &pound;250,000 goes to the Ness River Public Art Programme in Inverness.
The reopened cinema will provide employment and play and important part in the promotion of Kintyre as a unique visitor destination”
Philip Deverell, director of strategy at Creative Scotland, said: &quot;The cultural infrastructure of Scotland will be boosted by these ambitious and inspiring projects which have been a number of years in fruition.
&quot;Each is unique to their location, drawing on a range of inspirations whether historical, from the landscape or from the local community.
&quot;Each will help to ensure that artists and audiences, across Scotland, can continue to present, access and enjoy a range of artistic and creative experiences.&quot;
The Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust (PPMBT) will use the funds to help create Scotland's first centre for Children's Literature and Storytelling.
The project is inspired by JM Barrie and his world famous character Peter Pan.
Barrie spent five years at school at Dumfries Academy as a teenager and Moat Brae house and gardens were acknowledged by him as being &quot;the genesis&quot; for his classic tale.
The award will enable the trust to restore the house and the garden will be &quot;re-invented&quot; as JM Barrie's Neverland.
Project director Cathy Agnew said: &quot;To have news of this level of arts investment into Dumfries at the start of our capital campaign, is fantastic.
&quot;It is a great vote of confidence in the quality of our plans and designs to celebrate the birthplace of Peter Pan.&quot;
The funds to Campbeltown Community Business (CCB) will see the town's cinema - which first opened in 1913 - restored and a second screen and modern caf&eacute; and foyer area will be created. 
Jane Mayo, who chairs the CCB, said: &quot;The redeveloped picture house will provide the local community and visitors with a magnificent historic cinema equipped to modern standards and complemented by new facilities.
&quot;The programme of films and live relays of international quality cultural performances, together with activities based on the heritage of the building and the evolution of cinema, will allow The Picture House truly to become Kintyre's cultural and entertainment hub.
&quot;The reopened cinema will provide employment and play an important part in the promotion of Kintyre as a unique visitor destination.&quot;
The final funding award goes to Highland Council for its River Connections project.
Four artists have been commissioned to create new public art pieces as part of the area's Ness River Public Art Programme.
Councillor Ken Gowans, who chairs the authority's ICArts working group, said: &quot;This is a great opportunity for the city of Inverness and the Highlands to establish permanent high quality public art as an integral part of the major flood alleviation scheme for the city currently underway and which will enhance everyone's connections with the River Ness.&quot;###
94|||Manager Ronny Deila praised goalkeeper Craig Gordon and Celtic's resolute attitude after a 1-0 Europa League victory over Dinamo Zagreb . Celtic team spirit pleases manager Ronny Deila  Manager Ronny Deila praised goalkeeper Craig Gordon and Celtic's resolute attitude after a 1-0 Europa League victory over Dinamo Zagreb . 
 Gordon made three terrific stops as the home side protected an early goal from Kris Commons. 
 &quot;Craig was unbelievable,&quot; said Deila. &quot;We have him to thank for conceding zero goals and winning the game. 
 &quot;In the end it was fantastic team spirit. We have to take that with us but we need better passing.&quot; 
 The only goal came in the sixth minute when Emilio Izaguirre's pass, Commons' dummy and Anthony Stokes' return ball set up the influential playmaker to slam home a precise finish. 
 In a first half chock-full of goalmouth incidents, visiting striker Wilson Eduardo hit the crossbar and had a fierce volley well saved, while a dreadful touch from Zagreb keeper Eduardo should have been punished, with Commons and Stokes in close attendance. 
 The Croatian champions dominated for long spells after the break but Gordon would not be beaten, thwarting Wilson Eduardo again and pushing away a shot from Marcelo Brozovic. 
 &quot;Celtic have had good goalkeepers in the past and that is important,&quot; added Deila. &quot;It is an important place to have good players. 
 &quot;He was a prospect to come in before I was the manager but I knew he was a fantastic goalkeeper who was out for a long time with injury. 
 &quot;He can't do much better than he has shown. He can work on his kicking but he is a fantastic keeper and very calm.&quot; 
 Celtic are on four points in Group D, along with Red Bull Salzburg, and one ahead of Dinamo Zagreb. 
 With a double-header against FC Astra, who are yet to get off the mark, to come next, Deila is confident of making progress. 
 &quot;We have a good chance of getting the 10 points I think we will need,&quot; he said. 
 &quot;It is important for us to test ourselves against good teams but we need to have longer periods like the first half.&quot; 
 Visiting head coach Zoran Mamic thought his side deserved to take something from an entertaining fixture. 
 &quot;When you see the 90 minutes, we were the better team,&quot; he said. &quot;But football is about goals and we didn't score, so I have to say congratulations to Celtic. 
 &quot;In the last game against Astra, we didn't have as many shots on goal but won 5-1. I was sure we were going to score in the second half but it just didn't happen. 
 &quot;I'm sure it will be better for us when we play Celtic in Zagreb. I think that could be a decisive game in the group and we showed we have the quality to beat Celtic.&quot; 
 Stokes, without a European goal in three years, led the attack for Celtic and his partnership with Commons provided the game with its decisive moment. 
 &quot;It was a bit of a graft but we got there in the end with good team work,&quot; said the Irishman. 
 &quot;I think I've always had a good understanding with Kris and before the ball even came to him I knew he was going to leave it and it was just a matter of me putting it into the space.&quot; ###
95|||European football lite, perhaps, but this was a weighty occasion all the same. Europa League: Celtic win built on rock-solid keeper Craig Gordon  European football lite, perhaps, but this was a weighty occasion all the same. 
 Depending on your viewpoint, Celtic Park was either half full or half empty for the visit of the Croatians, but what was beyond dispute was that it was loud and, at the end, it was a thoroughly relieved place. 
 In so many stadiums where this competition is played the vibe will be underwhelming, but not here. Nobody would have mistaken it for a Champions League night, but there was an edge to proceedings because the game was so open and so frenetic. 
 It was madcap at times. The Keystone Cops with a football at their feet. Ronny Deila will be thrilled with the 1-0 victory , but the manner of it might leave him a little cold. Celtic were over-run for pretty much the entirety of the second half. They invited Dinamo on to them and only barely got out alive. 
 That was the nuance. The bottom line, however, was a win. And a precious win. 
 In the context of their Europa League group, this was a heavyweight night for Deila's team. The fact that it was in jeopardy right to the end only added to the atmosphere, the sense of dread that a draw might be snatched from the jaws of victory - again. 
 It was a big win, but hardly a big performance, with one outstanding exception. Craig Gordon was once again the difference, just as he was against Salzburg last month. The Croatians could have been hammering away at his goal for half the night and they might still not have beaten him. 
 Gordon is a signing to rank with any of the stellar captures at this club in recent years; an outrageous capture. For the princely sum of zero pounds, Deila has a world-class goalkeeper who is quite obviously back to his best. A colossus, no question. 
 This might be the second-rate tournament in Europe but as Celtic came under the cosh amid wave after wave of second-half Dinamo pressure, the tension was unmistakeably first class. Celtic threatened to obliterate their own victory with panicky defending and a wastefulness in possession, but they survived. 
 They threatened only fleetingly and then busied themselves with the job of protecting their own goal. They worked hard and they'll have been tired men by the end of it, physically and mentally. 
 Fish suppers all round, then.&nbsp; 
 How we saw only one goal - a clinical thing of beauty orchestrated by Anthony Stokes and Kris Commons - is a question that could puzzle the biggest boffin in the game. Gordon's brilliance explains part of it, but not all of it. Celtic had chances of their own and didn't take them. They weren't in the same league as Dinamo in profligacy terms but they could have scored more. 
 It was that kind of night. 
 The lone goal went in on nine minutes - a piece of opportunism that wouldn't have been out of place had it settled an illustrious Champions League contest - but chances flowed all night, some nicely carved out, others the product of hapless play from both sides. 
 If this was a boxing match then you would say that the pugilists went toe-to-toe for the entire evening, but it was a fight where so many opportunities were created and so few blows were landed. 
 Dinamo will go back to Zagreb in a state of utter frustration and confusion. They missed a simple header right in front of goal, they rattled a crossbar, they forced a wonderful flying save from Gordon and then fluffed a glorious one-on-one with the goalkeeper - Gordon again denying them. 
 And all that lot was just the work of one man - Wilson Eduardo. 
 The visitors had Celtic on the ropes for much of the second half, but pounded away to no avail. It was almost ridiculous. Mountains of possession and territory and no breakthrough. And for that, they will curse the Celtic goalkeeper's name, just as Salzburg cursed it. 
 Gordon's saves are one thing, but his authority is another part of his make-up. He is the epitome of composure, a rock in that storm that came blowing Celtic's way in the second half. 
 Eduardo was a beaten attacker at the end. So, too, Marcelo Brozevic and El Arabi Hilal Soudani, the pair of them seeing their big moments snuffed out by Gordon's alertness. Deila will like the look of the Europa League table but he won't be fooled by the story behind it. 
 Celtic continue to give up way too many chances in these European games - the same sin that cost them their place in the Champions League despite having two cracks at it. 
 This was a pleasing win for Deila, though. Flawed and with questions to ponder, but probably his best day yet. ###

97|||ARTS groups across Scotland are facing a cash crisis after it emerged a crucial new funding pot has been dramatically over-subscribed Scottish arts in grip of funding crisis Sponsored by

  
ARTS groups across Scotland are facing a cash crisis after it emerged a crucial new funding pot has been dramatically over-subscribed.

Creative Scotland is grappling with a nightmare task of handling &pound;212 million worth of applications for a fund with a &pound;90m cap.
The number of applicants to the body for regular support has also virtually doubled.
The funding body, which has spent months examining some 264 different applications, may have to placate dozens of venues, events, festivals and artistic bodies if their plans are scuppered within the next few weeks.
Creative Scotland, which pledged to end traditional “hierarchies” with a new simplified funding regime, has refused to guarantee funding to any organisation in the country beyond the current financial year.
Although senior staff at the quango will be recommending which applications are approved this week, final decisions on who will receive regular funding over the next three years will not be announced until the end of next month.
With just &pound;90m available over the next three years, the fact that the funding pot has been oversubscribed by more than 130 per cent raises the prospect of events, festivals, venues and arts organisations having to shelve plans or drastically cut back what they were planning to do from next spring.
Creative Scotland has admitted the task of deciding on the applications will be “extremely challenging” because its overall budget has not improved in recent years. Insiders say although the body is lobbying for greater backing for the cultural sector from the Scottish Government, this is unlikely to help deal with the demand from those seeking regular support.
The current situation means that prestigious events like the Edinburgh International Festival, Glasgow’s annual Celtic Connections, Orkney’s St Magnus Festival and the Hebridean Celtic Festival are in the dark over their level of future support.
Also affected are the Arches Theatre in Glasgow, the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, Dundee Contemporary Arts centre, Eden Court Theatre in Inverness and Pitlochry Festival Theatre, as well as organisations like Shetland Arts, the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and Hands Up For Trad.
Creative Scotland’s chief executive Janet Archer, who was appointed last summer, said the assessment process of the 264 applications for regular funding had been the organisation’s “top priority” in recent months.
She added: “The standard of applications has been extremely high and the quality of thinking, scale of ambition and the creative potential that these demonstrate is impressive. This makes the task of assessment and ultimate decision-making extremely challenging.
“It is our role to protect the levels of funding currently available to sectors we support. It is also our role to make the case for culture at every given opportunity in order to increase available support in the future.”
Although Creative Scotland has streamlined its funding programmes from the end of this financial year, just &pound;30m from its &pound;100m budget has been set aside for long-term agreements with the cultural sector, roughly the same as under previous arrangements.

98|||TWO men have been handed football banning orders after being arrested following a controversial protest march Pair given football ban over Gallowgate protest TWO men have been handed football banning orders after being arrested following a controversial protest march.


Nicholas Diplacito, 29, and Mark Glancy, 24, were part of a large scale disturbance before a Celtic and Aberdeen match in March last year.
Celtic fans group the Green Brigade had organised a “corteo” to back supporters who it felt had been harshly treated by the club and the procurator fiscal following recent law changes.
Around 200 police officers were reportedly deployed to the control the 300-strong gathering outside the Chrystal Bell pub in Glasgow’s Gallowgate.
Police were eventually forced to take action after many of those present began protesting on the road - against an agreement that fans could only march on the pavement.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard officers spotted Glancy outside a cordon and “laid hands” on him in a bid to control him.
Prosecutor Stephen Ferguson said: “Glancy in an apparent response to this began to behave in an aggressive manner towards the police officer. 
“He began to lash out with his hands and the police officer decided he should be placed under arrest.”
As Glancy continued to struggle, Diplacito - who did not know him - pulled him from the grip of the police and pushed the officers away.
Although he broke free, other offices got hold of Glancy again. He was later found with a &pound;5 ecstasy pill.
Diplacito meantime approached two other police officers in a “confrontation manner”.
The court heard he yelled “scum, scum, scum” at them leading to him also being arrested.
Police also later found on him a small amount of cannabis.
Glancy, of the city’s Gorbals, pled guilty to “resisting, obstructing, molesting and hindering” police and breaking free from them.
He also admitted possession of ecstasy.
Diplacito, of Lanark, South Lanarkshire, admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, struggling with officers and breaking Glancy free from custody as well as a charge of possession of cannabis.
The court heard the protest had been against the recently introduced Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Scotland Act.
The Green Brigade said at the time that march was to “raise awareness and show support for the growing list of Celtic supporters receiving and facing bans”.
Glancy’s lawyer Paul Kavanagh today told the court it was “fairly evident” police had initially pushed him and that was why he reacted.
Mr Kavanagh - who claimed Glancy was from a “good background” and “well educated” - added he had not been part of the march at first and had only later joined in.
The court further heard that Diplacito had gone out that day intending to go to the game and had not planned to be par of any protest.
Sheriff Paul Crozier handed each a one year football banning order.
Diplacito was also ordered to carry out 135 hours of unpaid work while Glancy was fined &pound;630.

They had to survive a series of nervy moments, mostly in the second half, and were again indebted to the rejuvenated figure of goalkeeper Craig Gordon as they preserved all three points and claimed the initiative at the top of Group D.
This was still some way short of the performance level which will earn Deila the faith of the Celtic fans, but it displayed a capacity to dig in for victory.
Celtic Park was intentionally half-empty, with the top tier of the stadium not being used in anticipation of the less than thunderous stampede for tickets. But while the Europa League may be an anti-climax for supporters who have become accustomed to big Champions League nights in Glasgow, those who did turn up managed to create a good atmosphere.
The mood was certainly enhanced by the flying start to proceedings for Deila’s men. It was a sweetly constructed and superbly finished goal, so typical of the creativity and imagination which Commons so often delivers for Celtic.
The 31-year-old dummied a pass from Emilio Izaguirre, allowing the ball to run into the path of Anthony Stokes. As Commons peeled off and stole in behind the wrong-footed Dinamo central defenders, Stokes picked him out with a perfectly weighted pass. Striding on to the ball, Commons drilled it low beyond goalkeeper Eduardo’s left hand into the corner of the net.
With John Guidetti ineligible and Stefan Scepovic injured, it was Stokes who led the line for the home side, while Commons was flanked by Alexandar Tonev and Mubarak Wakaso in the advanced midfield trio.
It was another opportunity for Tonev to try to make a positive impression, the on-loan Aston Villa winger having been singularly unimpressive in his previous appearances. He at least looked eager to get involved on this occasion and came close to doubling Celtic’s lead when he cut inside from the right and drove a 22-yard shot narrowly wide of Eduardo’s left-hand post.
Dinamo took time to settle but gradually found some composure and ambition in response to their early setback. Their first opening of the night came in the 18th minute, when Portuguese right-back Ivo Pinto surged forward and delivered a fine cross which his compatriot, Wilson Eduardo, headed over from around eight yards.
As the game became increasingly open and flowed from end to end, more than the home fans would have liked, Wilson came even closer to an equaliser ten minutes later. He dispossessed Stefan Johansen with a robust challenge and let fly with a dipping shot from 22 yards which smacked off Gordon’s crossbar.
There was a clear sense that Celtic might need more than one goal to win this contest and they should have made it 2-0 in the 32nd minute. Commons showed great energy and persistence to close down Eduardo inside the penalty area, forcing a mistake from the ’keeper who mishit the ball directly to him. It left Commons with the apparently simple task of squaring the ball to the unmarked Stokes for a tap-in on the edge of the six yard box. But, inexplicably and uncharacteristically, he overhit the pass behind his team-mate, leaving both of them holding their heads in disbelief.
Dinamo seemed further encouraged by that reprieve and both Pinto and Wilson came close with efforts from distance.
Tonev tried to get Celtic back on the front foot when he drifted infield again and drove in a low shot which was clutched by Eduardo. Dinamo were soon threatening again, Wilson seizing on a poor attempted clearance from Efe Ambrose and striking a fierce shot which forced Gordon into a fine save.
The fluid nature of the match was underlined just before half-time when Virgil van Dijk meandered forward to join the Celtic attack and tried his luck from 25 yards, his cleanly struck effort well dealt with by Eduardo.
Dinamo were almost caught cold right at the start of the second half when a lofted through ball from Commons allowed Johansen to race into the penalty area. Unfortunately for Celtic, the Norwegian midfielder could not get the ball under control properly, allowing Josip Pivaric time to make a crucial covering tackle.
The home side were struggling to sustain that kind of attacking momentum, while Dinamo looked increasingly dangerous. They should have taken advantage of poor communication in the Celtic ranks in the 54th minute, no-one tracking a move in which El Arabi Soudani set up Wilson with a free shot at goal which he wastefully hit too close to Gordon.
Celtic looked vulnerable and ever more anxious. They required Gordon to be at his most alert when he plunged low to his right to touch Marcelo Brozovic’s 20-yard shot behind for a corner. In a bid to shore up his team in midfield, Deila responded by withdrawing Commons and bringing on Beram Kayal.
He was followed into the fray by Leigh Griffiths. In a rare appearance for the striker, his most notable contribution was to hold the ball up in the corner in the closing seconds as Celtic survived a late Dinamo onslaught.

Celtic: Gordon, Denayer, Ambrose, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Tonev (Berget 88), Johansen, Brown, Wakaso (Griffiths 78), Commons (Kayal 69), Stokes. Subs not used: Zaluska, O’Connell, Fisher, Henderson.

Councillors on South Ayrshire Council approved the scheme at a Planning Hearing on Thursday, overturning their officers’ recommendation for refusal.
A separate planning application for a three unit retail development and change of trading conditions at the Heathfield Retail Park in Ayr, reported to be anchored by Marks &amp; Spencer, was also approved.
Waitrose said the new store, which will be built on land beside the Holmston Roundabout next to Dobbies Garden Centre, will bring around 180 new jobs when it opens in early 2016.
Councillors accepted arguments put forward by the developers, Dawn Developments Ltd, the scheme would bring benefits to the area, voting 17 to 5 in favour.
Speaking after the Hearing, Alan Macdonald of Dawn Developments said: “South Ayrshire councillors made the right choice today.
“Granting Waitrose planning permission is a clear sign that Ayr is open for business.
“We'll work closely with the council in coming months to finalise the proposal and start construction.
“It's our aim to have Waitrose Ayr open by early 2016.”
Mark Gifford, head of retail operations for Waitrose said: “We are delighted that councillors share our confidence that the major investment in a new store will make a positive contribution to Ayr and deliver significant benefits, including new employment opportunities and more choice for local residents.
“There is a feeling that Ayr is a town very much on the up and we are excited to be part of that.
“We are grateful to everyone who took part in our consultation and who contacted the council on our behalf.”
Waitrose currently has two branches in Edinburgh (Comely Bank and Morningside); Byres Road Glasgow; Newton Mearns; Stirling; Helensburgh.
The retailer, part of the John Lewis Partnership, said it also hopes to lodge a planning application for another branch in Edinburgh at Corstorphine before the end of the year.

101|||THOMAS Feeney denies robbing 33-year-old woman and sexually assaulting her with attempt to rape. Sex attack accused tells Glasgow High Court he dressed up as a woman after female clothing found in caravan - Daily Record A MAN accused of a sex attack has told a court he dressed up as a woman in his spare time.
Thomas Feeney, 47, claimed he enjoyed wearing female clothing after he was asked about items said to belong to him which were found at a disused quarry.
Feeney denies robbing a 33-year-old woman and sexually assaulting her with intent to rape in a caravan near Shotts, Lanarkshire, on September 5 last year.
It is alleged that he tied the woman up with tape and robbed her of &pound;2000, car keys, a BMW, a pink thong and a purple bra.
Feeney also denies menacing the woman with an imitation gun. He claims that when the incident took place, he was driving his 10-year-old son to school.
The High Court in Glasgow has heard that Feeney’s DNA was found on cable ties, duct tape found in the caravan and trousers and pants the woman was wearing.
Asked if he could explain this, Feeney, from Airdrie, said: “I wasn’t there. I am being framed for this. I can’t explain it. It must have been transferred somehow.”
Feeney was asked about a phone, a gun and women’s clothing found at a disused quarry months after the incident. Referring to the phone, he said: “It is mine. It’s an old one. I hadn’t used it since 2007 or 2008.”
He said he knew nothing about the garments but claimed the quarry was a place he went to wear women’s clothing.
He added: “It’s private. It’s what I’ve done for four or five years. I go to country places and wear women’s clothes.”
Feeney denied that the gun belonged to him and said that plastic ballbearings for that type of gun which were found in his garage had been planted there.
Iain McSporran, prosecuting, asked: “Do you not see how preposterous your position is?” Feeney said: ‘Yes, but I wasn’t there.”
The trial, before judge Norman Ritchie QC, continues.###
102|||Paisley woman Laura Haveron is due to fly to Namibia on Monday, having spent two years preparing for the adventure I'm going nowhere - Daily Record A heartbroken florist’s dream trip to Africa to take part in a charity trek was in tatters last night...after she lost her passport during a shopping expedition.
Paisley woman Laura Haveron is due to fly to Namibia on Monday, having spent two years preparing for the adventure.
However, she has been left grounded by her shopping mishap – and her only hope is that someone finds the missing passport within the next 72 hours.
Laura, 26, told the Paisley Daily Express: “I’m absoutely gutted.
“I was in tears when I realised I’d lost my passport.
“I’d been so looking forward to going to Africa for the charity trek but losing my passport has killed my dream.
“All I can do is plead for help to find it.
“I’ve been preparing for the charity challenge for two years but, unless my passport turns up, it will all be ruined.”
Laura, of Castle Gait, lost the passport while she was out shopping on Monday.
She had visited shops in George Street and Paisley town centre before moving on to Renfrew, and her heart sank when she got out of her car and discovered her passport was gone.
Laura, who signed up for the 100-mile African trek to raise cash for a cancer charity, contacted the Passport Office in Glasgow, in the hope they could issue a replacement as an emergency measure, but has been left disappointed.
She said: “I was told it would take at least a week to get a replacement because it is classed as a lost passport but that will be too late for me to travel to Africa.
“I’m due to take part in a trek through the Namib Desert in aid of the Michelle Henderson Cervical Cancer Trust and have been training hard for it – working at the gym and running outdoors.
“My cousin and I have raised more than &pound;4,000 for the charity through various activities, including a climb up Ben Lomond in preparation for the trek, so I’d be devastated to miss out now.”
Laura has also been in touch with the police, in the hope someone had handed her passport to them, but had no luck there either.
She added: “I’d be so grateful if someone was able to come to the rescue by finding my passport.”

103|||THE hunky star, who was playing at a pro-am golf tournament in St Andrews, revealed how he had enjoyed the nightlife of Scotland's biggest city. Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan tells how he struggled to be a hit with the ladies in Glasgow's nightclubs - Daily Record FIFTY Shades Of Grey Star Jamie Dornan might be giving ladies around the world hot flushes but the strapping actor used to be found sweating it out on the dancefloor of a Scots nightclub.
Jamie, who plays erotic billionaire Christian Grey in the forthcoming movie of the best selling book, was in Scotland to play the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and revealed that he used to be a regular at The Glasgow Garage club and student unions.
&nbsp;

Coming off the 18th hole at Carnoustie he said: &quot;I've&nbsp; done my time in Scotland. I spent a lot of time here with student friends. They were all in Glasgow so I had many a fun night in Glasgow. It's been a while now, probably about ten years ago, but we'd go to The Garage. That was one of the clubs and the students union was always a big one. I doubt I was a hit with the Scottish ladies.&quot;
Jamie, whose wife Amelia Warner gave birth to their first child in December, wasn't enamoured with his play on the course, despite his film character's reputation for er, swinging.
 

After joking we'd heard he was good at the sport he replied: &quot;Who did you hear that from? This is my first time playing golf here and it's tricky out there. I'm hoping it's going to get easier but the rain is coming tomorrow so I doubt that. I was here in 1999 when Jean van Delvelde was having fun in the burn there and Paul Laurie took it home. I was 17 years old and stood here on the 18th green watching all this happen.&quot;
The actor who is more brooding than witty, admitted playing golf was bit of respite from his upcoming movie and TV work.
He said: &quot;This week is a bit of a rest. I've got a lot going on and and have a job coming up in a couple of weeks so probably should be doing some work. I have to do a lot of prep cause it's a job like any other. I do slightly more strenuous things to keep fit but you don't get many tubby golfers. I don't know when I'll next be in Scotland but I always enjoy it. The genes are similar, We probably share some similarities -&nbsp;&nbsp; socially on the drink.&quot;
He added: &quot;It's been good fun with Bill Murray. He's a legend with a great swing and he can't stay serious for too long and he was great company. It was jokes all round until I was hitting it so badly I couldn't really stand for jokes anymore. I'm now going to have a pint here or get back to St. Andrews where I'm staying to reflect and try to work out how to play golf tomorrow.&quot;
Bill Murray who couldn't wait to have a bowl of soup with maybe &quot;half a pint of sherry in it&quot; after his round of golf admitted that playing with Jamie wasn't as funny as it could have been.
He said: &quot;Jamie is kind of the strong silent type and our conversations were interspersed like two amateurs kayaking across the ocean heading in separate directions&nbsp;&nbsp; and getting together back at the tee. He had a little more trouble than I had. He started strong and didn't have a lot of sleep. Because of the new baby he's sleep deprived.&quot;
Bill who said he'd been on a boat trip round the Isle of May and talked with the seals also revealed he'd been at George Clooney's wedding but hadn't bought him and his new bride a present.
He said: &quot;It wasn't as momentous for me because I didn't get married although I had a wonderful time and I got moist. They are two wonderful people and very happy. You don't buy them anything as a present. You are asked not to bring anything and asked to leave without anything.&quot;

104|||A judge who banned former Rangers owner Craig Whyte from being a company director for 15 years said his conduct of the business was "characterised by dishonesty". Judge: Craig Whyte was characterised by dishonesty at Rangers A judge who banned former Rangers owner Craig Whyte from being a company director for 15 years said his conduct of the business was "characterised by dishonesty".Lord Tyre gave a decision to impose the maximum ban on Whyte from the bench earlier in the week at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after Business Secretary Vince Cable brought a petition. His written opinion was issued today.Whyte, 43, became a director at Rangers in 2011 but it went into administration the following year before being wound up.Lord Tyre said: &quot;Immediately upon his appointment as a director or Rangers the respondent (Whyte) caused Rangers to enter into the Ticketus agreement, for the sole or main purpose of facilitating his acquisition of Rangers by providing finance which was lent by Rangers to Wavetower, which in turn used it to repay Rangers' external debt, notably to Lloyds Banking Group.&quot;&quot;In effect, a significant proportion to Rangers' prospective income for the next three years was used to pay the bank and thus to fund the respondent's acquisition of the club.&quot;&quot;On the basis of the material placed before me, it seems to me that there is a strongly arguable case that this amounted to financial assistance prohibited by section 678 of the Companies Act 2006, and accordingly constituted an offence,&quot; said the judge.Lord Tyre added: &quot;In any event I am satisfied that the Ticketus agreement was entered into by Rangers, under the direction of the respondent, for the benefit of the respondent and not the company, and accordingly constituted a deliberate breach of his fiduciary duty as a director.&quot;&quot;The fact that this was done, knowingly, in breach of the express terms of the share purchase agreement enhances the reprehensible nature of the respondent's actings,&quot; he said.It was argued that Whyte deliberately and dishonestly concealed the Ticketus deal, under which it got the right to sell three years season tickets for &pound;24m, from other board members until its existence was found out by the company's financial controller from an independent source.Lord Tyre said: &quot;I am satisfied on the evidence that the allegation of dishonesty is established.&quot;Whyte had told the independent board committee at Rangers that funding of the deal would come from him and an email was sent indicating that a British Vigin Island company owned by him, Liberty Capital, was a source of funding, the court was told.He said Whyte held no board meetings and provided no information to other directors over the company's financial affairs, making it impossible for them to carry out their own duties as directors.It was also alleged that there was a failure by Whyte to exercise rights, granted by Wavetower to Rangers at the time of the share purchase, to receive payment on demand of sums to meet playing squad costs and a sum due to HM Revenue and Customs, dubbed the Small Tax Case.Lord Tyre said: &quot;In connection with this aspect there is again an element of dishonesty on the part of the respondent, in that a letter sent on his behalf in January 2012 contained certain untrue statements concerning funds available to Rangers.&quot;A further issue was the failure of Rangers under Whyte's ownership to meet its obligations to HMRC over PAYE, national insurance and VAT.Lord Tyre said: &quot;Acting to the exclusion of other directors, the respondent caused Rangers to stop making payment when due in respect of these liabilities from September 7 2011.&quot;The commercial court judge: &quot;By February 2012, when HMRC presented its petition for an administration order, a sum of around &pound;10.5m had accrued in respect of unpaid tax and unapplied interest.&quot;&quot;Through his actings at the time of and after acquisition of Rangers, the respondent demonstrated a reckless disregard for the interests of the company to which he owed fiduciary duties,&quot; he said.&quot;His conduct of the business was characterised by dishonesty, in relation to disclosure of the true source of the funds used to purchase the company and repay the bank debt, and by wilful disregard for his duties to the company and to the other members of the board,&quot; said the judge.He said that in acquiring Rangers and a subsequent sale of shares in Arsenal &quot;he placed his own interests before those of the company&quot;.&quot;He knowingly permitted the company to trade using money owed to HMRC, &quot; said Lord Tyre.The judge said that Whyte has had also shown &quot;a wilful disregard&quot; for the duties of a director over record keeping and co-operation with the liquidator of a second company Tixway.Lord Tyre said that little was known about Tixway, which went into liquidation in 2012, where Whyte was appointed as a director in 2008 following the ending of a previous seven-year ban as a director.&quot;It is clear from Tixway's bank statements that the company held funds. Entries in those statements strongly suggest that some of those funds were applied to meet personal expenditure of the respondent,&quot; he said &quot;Tixway is estimated to have a deficiency of liabilities over assets of around &pound;3m. In the absence of adequate records it is impossible to know how this deficit accumulated,&quot; he said.Payments from a bank account included &pound;395,991 to American Express and &pound;414 to a butcher in Grantown on Spey, in Morayshire.Lord Tyre said: &quot;In my assessment, the conduct of the respondent in the present case consists of a combination of dishonesty, disregard for the interests of companies to which he owed duties and of the creditors of those companies, use of Crown debts to finance trade, misappropriation of company funds (at least in the case of Tixway) for private purposes, and wilful breach of a director's administrative duties, the effect of all of which is that the case can be regarded as quite out of the ordinary.&quot;Whyte, formerly of Castle Grant, Grantown on Spey, and RueDe Tenao, Monaco, was not represented at the hearing where he was banned. An amendment to the court document was granted to state that his current place of residence is unknown.###

Norovirus forces ward closures The closure of seven hospital wards has marked the start of the winter vomiting bug season, health officials have said.Health Protection Scotland (HPS) confirmed that norovirus led to the closures at six hospitals in four NHS boards across Scotland. No further details were given.Norovirus generally causes mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea but can be more serious among the elderly and people who are already unwell.Dr Evonne Curran, infection control nurse consultant at HPS, said: &quot;Norovirus is a highly-infectious virus that causes outbreaks in the community, healthcare and care settings every year.&quot;This is about the time of year when norovirus season usually starts.&quot;Letting everyone know that norovirus season has started enables preparedness plans to be put in to action.&quot;Health professionals across NHS Scotland are working to minimise the likelihood of outbreaks arising and the public is being asked to play their part too.&quot;To help reduce the risk of outbreaks in hospitals, care settings and the wider community, we are again asking members of the public who think they have norovirus to stay at home until at least 48 hours after any symptoms have stopped.&quot;As norovirus is so infectious, it is important that everyone plays their part in reducing outbreak risks. To do this, hospitals may suspend access to particular wards to protect patients, staff and visitors from norovirus.&quot;With the public's help, we can limit the impact of any norovirus outbreaks that do occur and minimise disruption to healthcare services.&quot;HPS said they would continue to monitor the situation on a weekly basis and will support NHS boards as required to ensure that any disruption to healthcare services is minimised.###
109|||GLASGOW Airport has received a boost after Canadian airline WestJet confirmed its intention to introduce daily, direct flights between Glasgow and Halifax, from summer 2015 WestJet confirms Glasgow-Canada flights from 2015 GLASGOW Airport has received a boost after Canadian airline WestJet confirmed its intention to introduce daily, direct flights between Glasgow and Halifax, from summer 2015.

The new link-up will mark the first time the firm has served an airport in the UK, and only the second transatlantic route following the launch of flights to Dublin. 
Halifax - the capital of the Nova Scotia province - has strong ties with Scotland, both culturally and historically.
In honour of the connection, WestJet will number the Glasgow flight WS30, to mark St Andrew’s Day on November 30.
The maiden journey will leave from Glasgow on May 30 2015, and fly daily until October 24. 
The flight will last five hours 15 minutes, and be operated by one of the airline’s 136-seater Boeing Next-Generation 737-700 aircraft.
Managing Director of Glasgow Airport, Amanda McMillan, welcomed the new route, adding: “This is fantastic news for Glasgow Airport and for Scotland. 
“WestJet is an ambitious airline with an extensive route network and we’re delighted it has chosen Glasgow as its first ever UK destination. 
“Scotland has always enjoyed a close relationship with Canada and not only will the daily service to Halifax provide our customers with greater choice, it will further strengthen our long haul connectivity.
“This announcement underlines our commitment to delivering the routes and services our customers demand and we are looking forward to welcoming WestJet to Glasgow.”
Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chair of the city’s Marketing Bureau added: “WestJet’s new route from Halifax is a major boost for Glasgow, providing the perfect opportunity to strengthen cultural and business links between both cities. 
“There will undoubtedly be strong demand for this service, which has huge potential to deliver significant inbound leisure tourism.”
The confirmation of the new route comes just days after Glasgow Airport confirmed it would be adding extra flights to Orlando, in Florida.###
110|||A teenager has been raped in broad daylight on a cycle path Glasgow teenager raped in cycle path attack A teenager has been raped in broad daylight on a cycle path.

The 18-year-old was attacked at about 2.15pm yesterday between Johnstone and Linwood in Renfrewshire.
She was not hurt but has been left “extremely distressed”, Police Scotland said.
The victim was confronted by a man at an area of the path known locally as “the pencil” statue.
After waiting for a woman pushing a pram to walk past, he grabbed the victim and dragged her into nearby bushes, where he subjected her to a serious sexual assault.
He then made off in the direction of Johnstone.
Detective Inspector Mark McGowan said: “The victim and her family are extremely distressed following her ordeal and our specially-trained officers are supporting her.
“I’d like to reassure the local community that we are continuing significant enquiries into this incident.
“This was a sunny day and there would have been a number of people using the cycle track at this time.
“I need them and the woman who the victim described as pushing a pram at the same time the man stopped to come forward and help me identify the person responsible for putting this young woman through this terrifying ordeal while she was simply making her home.”
The man is described as white, between 20 and 30, 5ft 10ins, of slim build and with a local accent.
At the time of the incident he was wearing a grey hooded top and grey matching bottoms.
He was also carrying a green cylindrical bag, similar to a tent bag, over his shoulder.###
111|||AN outbreak of salmonella is being linked to the hospitality section at Celtic Park, according to health officials Salmonella outbreak linked to Celtic hospitality AN outbreak of salmonella is being linked to the hospitality section at Celtic Park, according to health officials.

Eleven cases are being looked into by the public health protection arm of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGCC). 
All individuals affected had eaten at the club’s hospitality facilities on Sunday September 21.
One person who had an existing health condition spent a short period of time in hospital and has since been discharged, while the others were described as recovering at home.
Environmental Health officers visited the premises and said that they were satisfied that the food production processes at Celtic Park were appropriate.
The food business operator concerned is co-operating fully with the probe.
Dr Gillian Penrice, chief consultant in public health medicine at NHSGCC said: “The incubation period for salmonella is usually between 24 to 72 hours, meaning that the likelihood of any new cases linked to this situation is small.
“All 11 cases are recovering at home and our investigations into the source are continuing.
“I would stress, however, that this appears to have been an isolated cluster of cases, that there is no ongoing risk to customers and that we are satisfied with the food handling and hygiene at Celtic Park.”
The investigation is currently centred on outside suppliers of ingredients, but the Food Standards Agency has said that there are no other related salmonella incidents that they are aware of. 
Salmonella is a group of bacteria that can cause diarrhoea, with infections usually resolving within seven days.###
112|||HERO George Ferrier was hit with a baseball bat as robbers raided the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow before getting away with a haul of luxury watches. Hero security guard tells of ordeal as robbers clubbed him to the ground during raid on Glasgow arcade - Daily Record THE heist took place in broad daylight, targeting elite jewellers on Scotland’s most famous shopping street, and was captured on CCTV.
The swiftness of the raid and the brutality of its execution was the stuff of movies - and several shoppers made their own videos as the terrifying action unfolded.
The Daily Record has now tracked down the unwitting hero of the CCTV and mobile phone film clips that became sensations on social media.
Grandad George Ferrier, 56, was the top-hatted security guard who took on the four masked raiders who descended on the Argyll Arcade on Glasgow’s Buchanan Street on Wednesday, September 24.
For his troubles, which went way beyond the line of duty, heroic George was clubbed down and hospitalised by the “ninjas in the mist” raiders but his only thoughts were for the workers he was employed to defend.
Last night he still sported deep bruises to the back of his legs, where one raider smashed him with a baseball bat as he guarded the posh mall.
Still traumatised from his ordeal, brave George told how adrenaline and instinct kicked in during the raid, which lasted 57 seconds and netted a haul of watches worth &pound;200,000.
He said: “It came out of the blue and I didn’t really have time to think. I can barely remember what they were shouting but my only real instinct was to make sure none of the girls in the shops were in danger. That’s what I’m paid for.

“I got quite a hard whack in the legs but I got up and, for some reason, put my top hat back on, as the penny dropped about what was happening.
“My main memory was these four figures dressed in black emerging from the smoke with balaclavas on, carrying axes, a sledgehammer and what I thought was a baseball bat.
“My first thought was that I might be able to grab the guy with the baseball bat but when the smoke cleared a bit I could see the guy coming at me actually had an axe - so I thought, ‘I’m not paid enough for this’.
“I remember thinking they looked like ninjas. With the weapons they had, it could have been a lot worse.”
Four high-end jewellery shops – Rox, Mappin &amp; Webb, Laing the Jeweller and Lewis Grant – were targeted.
But the gang only got away with 18 high-end watches from Rox.
Videos and still photographs posted on Facebook and Twitter show George being clubbed in the back of his knees as he stands guard in the mall.
He instinctively rises to his feet and, despite his excruciating injuries, is seen staggering after the raiders into the arcade.
 

A few seconds later, after the robbers have hit four elite jewellers, George is seen clearly shepherding staff back into their shops and out of danger as axe-wielding robbers emerge from the smoke, screaming that they will kill whoever gets in their way.
They run past George on their way to Buchanan Street before escaping via a side street to a waiting getaway car.
George said: “There are normally three guards on shift but that reduces to two at lunchtime. I don’t know if the robbers were aware of this.
“I was pacing between Buchanan Street and a stairway a few yards inside the arcade when I heard the commotion. I was looking into the arcade and, just as I turned my head back towards Buchanan Street, a guy whacked me on the legs.
“I honestly don’t remember what the guys were shouting but I think it was threats, from what other people have said.
“When I hit the deck I was down for a few seconds but my instinct was to get up. I think it’s maybe a Glasgow thing or it’s just survival instinct - I was determined to get up fast before anyone jumped on me and got on top of me.
“They ran past me towards Rox and I became aware of the smoke going up, so I knew someone had hit the panic button, which was good.
“I ran in the direction the robbers had gone and I was making towards Rox. The staff there are all female and that might have been in the robbers’ minds.
“I’m aware that I got as far as Mr Harold and Laings and I was shouting to the staff, “Get inside and lock the f****** door.’
“I’m a bit embarrassed for the language and I apologise for it but I guess I was under a bit of pressure at the time.
“At this stage I wasn’t too aware of the pain in my legs but I guess this was just adrenaline. When I saw the guys running back at me and I saw the axe I just wanted to step aside and let them go, which I did. I held my hands up and let them run past me.”
 

George, who has worked as a security guard at the Argyll Arcade for a year, said the raid showed a mix of professional and amateur touches.
He said: “They must have planned things quite well because they ran right into Rox. They have a wide open entry there and you can’t just press a button and close the doors.
“They were in and out inside a minute too, which was incredible speed.
“But taking a sledgehammer to the window of Mappin and Webb was a waste of time. You could drive a truck at that window and it wouldn’t cave in.”

Within two of the robbers fleeing, firefighters were on the scene, followed a few minutes later by police.
George was taken to the Royal Infirmary, where he was treated for severe bruising to his legs.
He later attended his GP, who diagnosed that he was suffering from stress relating to his trauma.
George said: “It seems a bit surreal to be honest and part of me wondered if it was a student prank.”
He said he will never forget the day as it was his partner Annette Bradshaw’s 53rd birthday.
He said: “Annette was out in town and she heard that there had been a raid at the Argyll Arcade and she thought she was getting a wind-up.
“But the videos were all popping up on the internet within five minutes of the raid happening, so she soon realised it was true.
“She was worried sick and it was quite obvious in the videos that it was me that was being attacked.”
George, from Springburn, Glasgow, told how he was given a dressing down after a previous theft from a store, after he chased a raider down Buchanan Street.

He said: “It was a smartly dressed guy who snatched a watch from Rox and he just took off and ran down Buchanan Street. There was no way I was catching him but I took after him by instinct.
“When I got back I get a right talking to, as we’re not insured beyond the boundaries of the Argyll Arcade.”
You get to know the people to look out for. If someone comes in chewing gum, it’s a red flag right away because this is an old trick.
 

“People have used this to steal rings by getting a selection out to try on. They will get the gum in their finger and quickly stick a ring to it and conceal it under a desk.
“That means that if they are searched they won’t have any stolen item on them and an accomplice can come in and remove the ring.”
George’s normal working day involves starting at 7am, when he dresses in a formal uniform, involving a tailed coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes and top hat.
The gang, who are still at large, escaped with 18 luxury Hublot and Bell &amp; Ross watches.
Three Hublots, worth &pound;31,600, were also damaged during the robbery.
If the windows they targeted had smashed it is thought the haul could have been millions.
They sped off in a white Volkswagen Golf, later swapped for a Vauxhall Combo van, which joined the M8 bound for Edinburgh.

113|||Dad of three, Stuart who suffered a cardiac arrest said nothing would stop him marrying his partner, Louise. Heartbreak to happiness for Dumfries couple - Daily Record A Dumfries dad whose wedding was postponed after he had a heart attack has finally tied the knot.
Stuart McIver married sweetheart Louise Smith at the Crichton Church on Sunday – a month after the planned date.
The 28-year-old mechanic said: “I wasn’t going to let a cardiac arrest stop me marrying her.”
The couple, who have three children, were watching TV in their Rae Street home on August 24 when the normally healthy Stuart collapsed.
Louise, 29 said: “It looked like he was having an epileptic seizure.
“I didn’t know what was happening to him. His breathing was laboured and the paramedics told me not to touch him.”
Stuart, who had celebrated his stag do the day before, was rushed to Dumfries Infirmary before being transferred to the Golden Jubilee in Glasgow to have a defibrillator fitted.
Despite missing his wedding and spending 12 days in hospital Stuart can’t remember a thing about it due to short-term memory loss attributed to his heart attack.
He said: “It’s a very surreal experience. The paramedic told us only 10 per cent of people survive a cardiac arrest. I’m really lucky to be alive.”
And after the stress of missing his big day with Louise, Stuart was even more devastated when he discovered that medics had to cut up his favourite football strip to save his life.
He added: “I was gutted when I found out the paramedics cut me out of my Scotland top.”
Stuart and Louise, of Heathhall, have been together for five years and had been planning their wedding since getting engaged last July.
After Stuart took unwell they thought it would take at least another year to organise. But thanks to helpful businesses in the wedding industry and their guests, the couple were hitched at the weekend.
They roped in kids, Callum, eight, as ring bearer, Mia, seven, as flower girl and two-year-old Duncan to help.
Louise added: “It’s a wonderful feeling to finally be married.”###
114|||Paisley woman Laura Haveron is due to fly to Namibia on Monday, having spent two years preparing for the adventure. Scots woman devastated after losing passport just days before setting off for African charity trek - Daily Record A heartbroken florist’s dream trip to Africa to take part in a charity trek was in tatters...after she lost her passport during a shopping expedition.
Paisley woman Laura Haveron is due to fly to Namibia on Monday, having spent two years preparing for the adventure.
However, she has been left grounded by her shopping mishap – and her only hope is that someone finds the missing passport within the next 72 hours.
Laura, 26, told the Paisley Daily Express: “I’m absolutely gutted.
“I was in tears when I realised I’d lost my passport.
“I’d been so looking forward to going to Africa for the charity trek but losing my passport has killed my dream.
“All I can do is plead for help to find it.
“I’ve been preparing for the charity challenge for two years but, unless my passport turns up, it will all be ruined.”
Laura, of Castle Gait, lost the passport while she was out shopping on Monday.
She had visited shops in George Street and Paisley town centre before moving on to Renfrew, and her heart sank when she got out of her car and discovered her passport was gone.
Laura, who signed up for the 100-mile African trek to raise cash for a cancer charity, contacted the Passport Office in Glasgow, in the hope they could issue a replacement as an emergency measure, but has been left disappointed.
She said: “I was told it would take at least a week to get a replacement because it is classed as a lost passport but that will be too late for me to travel to Africa.
“I’m due to take part in a trek through the Namib Desert in aid of the Michelle Henderson Cervical Cancer Trust and have been training hard for it – working at the gym and running outdoors.
“My cousin and I have raised more than &pound;4,000 for the charity through various activities, including a climb up Ben Lomond in preparation for the trek, so I’d be devastated to miss out now.”
Laura has also been in touch with the police, in the hope someone had handed her passport to them, but had no luck there either.
She added: “I’d be so grateful if someone was able to come to the rescue by finding my passport.”

A&E rapped over blood-spattered cubicle HOSPITAL bosses have come under fire after a young mum was treated in a blood-spattered cubicle.Discarded needle covers, tissues and a used gown were also left lying in the cubicle at the Accident and Emergency unit at the Victoria Infirmary.The 30-year-old, who suffers from a chronic condition that requires regular hospital visits, took photographs on her mobile phone when she was sent to A&amp;E on Thursday.She said: &quot;They took me up to cubicle three and as soon as I went in I could see someone had been in just before me.&quot;There was a gown and a crumpled blanket on the bed.

Parents hit at plan for baby ashes PARENTS at the centre of Glasgow's baby ashes scandal have said a new report does not go far enough to help them.Those who were told they could not collect their child's remains have said the findings of the city council's Infant Cremation Working Group are just a &quot;box ticking exercise&quot;.As reported in yesterday's Evening Times, the committee has released its plans to make sure no family will suffer the agony of not knowing the location of their child's remains. The plans include using baby trays for all infant and baby cremations at Linn and Daldowie Crematoria. Ashes are now defined as all that remains following the cremation process.Linsay Bonar lost her baby, Lachlan, in 2006 and has campaigned for an apology to parents from the council.She said: &quot;The overwhelming feeling is that once again they are responsible to themselves and not to the parents who are affected and not responsible to the public.&quot;Reviews are not being carried out by external agencies. To be only accountable to yourself is not a step in the right direction.&quot;I have met council officials many times and have never received an apology - they do not seem to acknowledge they have done anything wrong.&quot;Although the baby trays are welcome, this is just a box ticking exercise.&quot;Other council changes has seen forms and paperwork revised to make sure they can be clearly and easily understood by all cremation applicants.Bereavement management from the council have also met funeral directors and NHS managers to make sure those who are dealing with the public can properly describe processes to bereaved parents.Stacey Lamb Stacey, from Tollcross, was the first to reveal her ordeal of the loss of her son, Daniel. She said: &quot;In a way this is progress because it won't happen to any other families again, but that doesn't help us, now.&quot;This brings home to us we were let down, but in a way I am happy other parents will not go through this, but it is hard to know I could have had something after all.&quot;A council spokesman said: &quot;We welcomed, and quickly adopted, the Infant Cremation Commission's interpretation of ashes as 'all that remains following the cremation process'. By using this definition it very likely we will return any ash to bereaved families, where they request it.&quot;catriona.stewart@eveningtimes.co.uk###

Judge details Whyte failings A JUDGE who banned former Rangers owner Craig Whyte from being a company director for 15 years said his conduct of the business was "characterised by dishonesty".Lord Tyre's written opinion has been issued following his decision to impose a maximum ban on Whyte at the Court of Session in Edinburgh earlier this week.Whyte, 43, became a director at Rangers in 2011 but it went into administration the following year before being wound up.Lord Tyre said: &quot;Immediately upon his appointment as a director or Rangers the respondent (Whyte) caused Rangers to enter into the Ticketus agreement, for the sole or main purpose of facilitating his acquisition of Rangers by providing finance which was lent by Rangers to Wavetower, which in turn used it to repay Rangers' external debt, notably to Lloyds Banking Group.&quot;In effect, a significant proportion to Rangers' prospective income for the next three years was used to pay the bank and thus to fund the respondent's acquisition of the club.&quot;A further issue was the failure of Rangers under Whyte's ownership to meet its obligations to HMRC over PAYE, national insurance and VAT.Lord Tyre said: &quot;Acting to the exclusion of other directors, the respondent caused Rangers to stop making payment when due in respect of these liabilities from September 7 2011.&quot;By February 2012, when HMRC presented its petition for an administration order, a sum of around &pound;10.5 million had accrued in respect of unpaid tax and unapplied interest.###

Sex attack man gets 12 years A CROSS-dresser has been jailed for 12 years after being convicted of a brutal sex attack on a woman at a remote caravan.Masked Thomas Feeney, 47, from Airdrie, tied up his victim at gunpoint and covered her mouth and eyes with duct tape before subjecting her to a humiliating ordeal.Minutes before Feeney had forced her to hand over &pound;2,000 in savings and also took the keys to her BMW 3 series car.Before he left Feeney, who told the court he likes to dress up as a woman, picked up a pink thong and a purple bra from the top of his 33-year-old victim's laundry bag.Feeney was found guilty of robbing and sexually assaulting the woman at a static caravan near Shotts, North Lanarkshire, on September 5 last year, with intent to rape.He was also convicted of using an imitation gun with intent to cause the woman to believe unlawful violence would be used against her. The High Court in Glasgow heard that the woman had been staying with her fiance in the remote static caravan while their dream home was being built. The cash was to pay builders' bills.The horrific incident ended with him driving off in her car which was later found abandoned.The court heard that Feeney's victim is now terrified to be alone as a result of the horrific attack on her.Judge Norman Ritchie QC told Feeney: &quot;This was a planned crime. You appear to have had some inside information about money within the caravan. You went to the caravan equipped with cable ties, duct tape, an imitation gun and masked and you chose a time when this woman would be on her own.&quot;You sexually abused her and your defence was preposterous.&quot;Feeney had claimed that he was framed for the crime by people who had it in for him.But the jury convicted him unanimously after hearing that his DNA was found in the caravan, which he claimed he had never visited.

145|||A 47-year-old man has been jailed for 12 years after being convicted of a robbing and sexually assaulting a woman at her caravan in North Lanarkshire. Crimewatch appeal North Lanarkshire sex attacker jailed A 47-year-old man has been jailed for 12 years after being convicted of a robbing and sexually assaulting a woman at her caravan in North Lanarkshire.
Thomas Feeney had a fake gun and wore a mask when he entered the 33-year-old's home, near Shotts, on 5 September 2013. 
Feeney, from Airdrie, tied her up before carrying out the sex attack.
The case featured on BBC's Crimewatch but Feeney was caught after his DNA was found on discarded items recovered at a quarry and on the victim's clothing.
Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, temporary judge Norman Ritchie QC told Feeney: &quot;This was a planned crime. You appear to have had some inside information about money within the caravan. 
&quot;You went to the caravan equipped with cable ties, duct tape, an imitation gun and masked and you chose a time when this woman would be on her own. 
&quot;You sexually abused her and your defence was preposterous.&quot; 
Judge Ritchie also placed Feeney on the sex offenders' register.
During Feeney's trial, the court heard that the woman had been staying with her fianc&eacute;e in the remote static caravan while their dream home was being built. 
After entering the caravan, Feeney forced the woman to hand over &pound;2,000 in savings, which was to be used to pay builders.
He also took the keys to her BMW 3 series car. 
Before he left Feeney picked up a pink thong and a purple bra from the victim's laundry bag.
In evidence, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was pushed into the bedroom and her wrists, eyes and mouth were bound with duct tape. 
She added: &quot;He said he was taking me with him and I was getting used as a sex slave.
&quot;He opened the bedroom door and pushed me onto the bed face first. He let go of me and shut the curtains. I thought he was going to rape me.&quot; 
She said the man then pulled up her top and pulled down her trousers before sexually assaulting her. 
The attack ended with him driving off in her car which was later found abandoned. 
Although Feeney left behind his DNA, he was not on the police database and initially the police had little to go on. 
The incident featured on BBC's Crimewatch programme but the breakthrough in the case came when a dog walker came across items thrown away at a disused quarry. 
Feeney's mobile phone was found alongside the woman's thong. 
His DNA matched that found on the woman's clothing and on a piece of duct tape and two cable ties found in the caravan. 
In evidence Feeney denied ever having been at the caravan and referring to the sex attack said: &quot;I would never do anything like that.&quot; 
He also claimed that he liked to dress up as a woman.
The jury, however, did not believe him and unanimously convicted Feeney of robbing and sexually assaulting the woman, with intent to rape. 
He was also convicted of using an imitation gun with intent to cause the woman to believe unlawful violence would be used against her.###

 Haile Gebrselassie will return to Glasgow on Sunday to defend his Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run title. 
 The former world and Olympic 10,000m gold medallist won in the fastest time ever recorded in Scotland for the 13.1-mile half-marathon distance. 
 The 41-year-old Ethiopian's time of 61 minutes nine seconds was also a world age-group record. 
 But Joe Pavey will miss out on a chance to win the women's event at the same age after pulling out through injury. 
 It would have marked her return to the city where she won a 5,000m bronze medal for England at the Commonwealth Games. 
 A record 30,000 participants of all ages lined up last year in Scotland's biggest running event, which is televised live on the BBC. 
 Runners can choose between a 10,000m or half-marathon challenge through the heart of the city, starting in George Square and finishing on Glasgow Green.

Shepherd and Wedderburn buys Tods Murray out of administration About 50 jobs are to go at Scottish law firm Tods Murray as it is bought out of administration by Shepherd and Wedderburn.
Administrators were appointed for Tods Murray, which has offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh, on Friday.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, will see the immediate transfer of all 170 staff to Shepherd and Wedderburn.
Shepherd and Wedderburn has offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and Aberdeen and last year had a turnover of &pound;38m.
Tods Murray was founded in 1856.
Of the staff joining Shepherd and Wedderburn, 18 will be as partners, five directors, and seven will be consultants.
Employees were informed of the situation on Friday, with a formal 45 day redundancy consultation process due to begin next week. 
We are very aware that this will be a difficult and uncertain time for everyone affected by today's announcement”
The initial proposal is for about 50 jobs to be subject to redundancy consultation. FRP Advisory have been handling the administration.
Stephen Gibb, chief executive of Shepherd and Wedderburn said: &quot;We will be welcoming many new colleagues into our team, as part of Shepherd and Wedderburn. 
&quot;Their clients can be assured of a continuation of the high level of service they have come to expect, as well as the opportunity to access the expanded range of legal expertise and advice we offer. 
&quot;Whilst inevitably there will be a need to rationalise, I am confident that the arrangement will provide significant benefits to our staff and client base.&quot;
After the acquisition, the firm will have 564 staff, including 82 partners.
For the year ending April 2014, turnover at Shepherd and Wedderburn increased from &pound;35.9m to &pound;38.3m and net profit rose by 10% to &pound;14.3m.
The Law Society of Scotland said Tods Murray going into administration represented &quot;the loss of a long established and very highly regarded Scottish law firm&quot;.
Chief executive Lorna Jack added: &quot;We are confident however that arrangements are being put in place to ensure that there is as little disruption as possible to the firm's clients as there is to be a full transfer of business to Shepherd and Wedderburn, one of Scotland's largest law firms.
&quot;While all Tods Murray staff will also transfer to Shepherd and Wedderburn, we are very aware that this will be a difficult and uncertain time for everyone affected by today's announcement. 
&quot;We already have a range of support services available to solicitors for these kinds of situations and we will be offering our help and support to those who need it.&quot;###
149|||A Salmonella outbreak in the Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Highland areas has been linked to hospitality at Celtic Park. Salmonella cases linked to hospitality at Celtic Park A Salmonella outbreak in the Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Highland areas has been linked to hospitality at Celtic Park.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said 11 people who had eaten at the stadium on 21 September, the day Celtic played Motherwell, had fallen ill.
The health board said all 11 cases were recovering in the community.
Environmental health teams are content with food production within Celtic Park kitchen and the investigation is focusing on external suppliers.
Dr Gillian Penrice, lead consultant in public health medicine at NHS GGC, said: &quot;The incubation period for salmonella is usually between 24 to 72 hours, meaning that the likelihood of any new cases linked to this situation is small.
&quot;All 11 cases are recovering at home and our investigations into the source are continuing. 
&quot;I would stress however that this appears to have been an isolated cluster of cases, that there is no ongoing risk to customers and that we are satisfied with the food handling and hygiene at Celtic Park.&quot;
NHS GGC said environmental health officers visited Celtic Park as soon as they became aware of the outbreak.
The officials were satisfied that the food production processes within the Celtic Park kitchen were &quot;appropriate&quot;.
The health board said the food business operator at the stadium was &quot;co-operating fully with the investigation&quot; which involves other health board areas, Health Protection Scotland, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Glasgow City Council environmental health.
NHS GGC said investigations were currently focusing on the external suppliers of ingredients to Celtic Park.
The FSA has advised that there are currently no other related salmonella incidents which they are aware of relating to any of the foods involved.
NHS GGC said nine of the 11 cases had been confirmed through laboratory testing.
One individual, who had an underlying health condition, required a short stay in hospital but was later discharged.###

Paul Deeney, 35, wore latex gloves, and a hood to stop him being recognised, while carrying out the attack on 33-year-old Mark McGaughie in May 2012.
He was jailed in February 2013 and ordered to serve at least 20 years.
Deeney claimed the judge in his trial had misdirected the jury but appeal court judges ruled there had not been a miscarriage of justice.
Lord Eassie, Lady Paton and Lady Smith ruled that trial judge Lord Brailsford had acted correctly when he gave legal directions to the jury. 
In a written judgement at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh, Lord Eassie wrote: &quot;We must refuse the appeal against conviction.&quot; 
The appeal court judges did, however, allow for an appeal against the sentence given to Deeney to go ahead. It will be heard at a later date.
Mr McGauchie was found dead at the property in the Argyll and Bute town's Cowal Place. 
Deeney's trial heard how he armed himself with a knife taken from his girlfriend's flat prior to the killing. 
He also put on latex gloves and doubled them up with a regular pair of gloves in a bid at preventing fingerprints being left behind. 
Deeney wore a hooded top to stop him being recognised during the killing. 
Passing sentence, Lord Brailsford told Deeney: &quot;Regarding the circumstances of the offence, this was premeditated. You went to the unfortunate victim's home and plainly murdered him.&quot; 
It emerged after the verdict that Deeney has a lengthy criminal past dating back to the 1990s. 
He had previously received jail terms of seven years and five years for charges of assault and robbery. 
Deeney, originally of Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, was convicted of a domestic assault months before the murder and was jailed for 40 days. ###

Emergency work on Grade A-listed Rothesay Pavilion One of Scotland's most significant surviving Art Deco buildings is to undergo emergency repair work ahead of a planned &pound;8m renovation.
Argyll and Bute Council is to spend &pound;335,000 stabilising parts of the Grade-A listed Rothesay Pavilion.
Some of the building was fenced off after weathering loosened stone facing. 
Repair work is due to be completed by next year. The 18-month renovation project will start in 2016, with completion scheduled for mid-2017. 
The building, on the Isle of Bute, dates back to the 1930s.
It sits at the end of the town's Victorian Esplanade, with views of Rothesay Bay, and across to the Cowal Peninsula and the Renfrewshire and Ayrshire coasts.
It was built in the era of the &quot;Big Band Sound&quot;, and was designed to host dancing and conference events as well as flower shows, weddings and sports activities.
Argyll and Bute Council hopes the &pound;8m revamp will transform it into a hub for sports, tourism and culture. 
Recent survey work revealed some sections of the building were in an advanced state of disrepair.
The authority said this had persuaded it to make the &quot;significant intervention&quot; of paying for emergency repairs from its general reserve fund.###

Herish Rostam, 26, attacked the 29-year-old woman in Robertson Lane, near Argyle Street, on 14 December 2012.
The victim, who had been working as a prostitute, agreed to have sex with Rostam for &pound;25, but instead he attacked her once they went in to the lane.
Failed asylum seeker Rostam, who is an Iranian Kurd, was convicted of raping the woman at an earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
Jailing Rostam, temporary judge Bill Dunlop QC told him: &quot;You humiliated, degraded and brutalised her and for that you must pay the price.&quot; 
&quot;This was a vulnerable woman who was driven to prostitution.&quot; 
He also placed Rostam on the sex offenders' register. 
The court heard that the woman had turned to prostitution to buy Christmas presents for her children. 
She had agreed to have sex with Rostam for &pound;25 but was attacked by him when they went in to the lane.
Giving evidence, the victim told the court: &quot;I tried to move, but he was too strong. It went from something we had agreed to something he just wanted to do. 
&quot;He forced himself on me. I asked him to stop. He carried on doing it.&quot; 
Rostam, who gave evidence during his trial through an interpreter, denied raping the woman. 
When he appeared for sentencing, solicitor advocate Edward Gilroy, defending, said: &quot;Mr Rostam continues to deny responsibility, but he accepts he has been convicted of a serious offence.&quot; 
The court also heard of Rostam's past from prosecutor Jonathan Brodie QC.
He said: &quot;Mr Rostam is a failed asylum seeker who entered the UK in 2007. He has repeatedly asked to be allowed to stay in the UK and all these applications have been refused. 
&quot;He is currently awaiting permission to appeal again.&quot; ###
155|||A man who is serving a 10-year prison term for raping two women has had one of the convictions quashed on appeal. Rapist Gavin Livingstone has one conviction quashed A man who is serving a 10-year prison term for raping two women has had one of the convictions quashed on appeal.
Gavin Livingstone, 30, was jailed for raping the women between May 2006 and September 2012 in Ayrshire. 
Appeal judges said because jurors had deleted references to rape from one of the charges of which he was convicted, there was reasonable doubt over whether they intended to convict him of rape.
Livingstone's appeal against his sentence will be heard at a later date.
He was jailed in October 2013 after being convicted of carrying out numerous attacks on the woman at various locations in Ayrshire.
His appeal against his conviction and sentence was head at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh by judges Lady Smith, Lord Eassie and Lady Paton. 
In a written judgement issued on Friday, Lady Smith wrote: &quot;The jury were not, according to their deletions, satisfied that the appellant had raped the woman at all on the occasions referred to in the charge. 
&quot;In those circumstances and having had regard to the description of the woman's evidence provided by the trial judge, we consider the jury's verdict to be so confused as to the criminal acts of which they were intending to convict the appellant. 
&quot;Accordingly it amounts to a miscarriage of justice.&quot; 
However, the appeal court did not quash Livingstone's other two rape convictions and a conviction for sexual assault with intent to rape. 
The judges also continued an appeal against Livingstone's 10-year sentence, which will be heard at some time in the near future. 
Livingstone, formerly of Doonholm Cottages, Ayr, was found guilty of rape and sexual assault charges following a trial at the High Court in Paisley in September 2013. 
The court heard how he abused the first woman at an address in Darvel, on an occasion between May 2006 and March 2007. 
Livingstone was said to have abused the other woman at an address in Kilmarnock having made contact with her on a dating website.###
156|||Two goals in three minutes gave Kilmarnock a deserved win that ended the six-game unbeaten run of Scottish Premiership leaders Dundee United.    Obadeyi 63′  Connolly 65′  
 Two goals in three minutes gave Kilmarnock a deserved win that ended the six-game unbeaten run of Scottish Premiership leaders Dundee United. 
 The Ayrshire side had the better of the first half against lacklustre visitors, who started - and finished - the night two points clear of Hamilton. 
 But Kilmarnock had to wait until the 63rd minute for the opener, Alexei Eremenko setting up Tope Obadeyi. 
 That clever finish was followed by a more conventional Mark Connolly header. 
 United failed to threaten a comeback that would have extended their winning run over Kilmarnock, who move above Inverness and reigning champions Celtic into third spot, to six games. 
 Visiting manager Jackie McNamara had said this week that, while he hoped his side could provide a challenge at the top, it was too early to label them as potential title contenders. 
 His caution was justified as the Terrors struggled to come to terms with lively opponents looking much more comfortable on the artificial surface installed this summer. 
 Following his fine performance against Partick Thistle, Finnish playmaker Eremenko was the architect again as Kilmarnock whipped the ball around a rain-soaked pitch. 
 United struggled to cope and Josh Magennis forced one near-post save from Radoslaw Cierzniak, before the Polish goalkeeper palmed a downward header clear. 
 A volley from Eremenko flew wide and another by Obadeyi should have hit the target rather than flying over from eight yards. 
 It took United 25 minutes to threaten, when Nadir Ciftci headed wide, but they began to impress themselves in the exchanges that followed. 
 Stuart Armstong had an effort blocked by Craig Samson at point-blank range. And, although the United man appeared to come off worse as the two collided, it was the home goalkeeper who had to be replaced at half-time with a suspected fractured toe. 
 But before the half ended, the visitors had a lucky break when Magennis outmuscled Callum Morris to reach Eremenko's ball over the top and the forward's chip over the advancing Cierzniak bounced in front of the unguarded goal but kissed the top of the bar. 
 Kilmarnock faded after the restart but United were unable to test Conor Brennan, the Northern Ireland Under-21 goalkeeper making his debut from the bench after leaving Leicester City in the summer. 
 However, the home side burst back into life when Eremenko flipped the ball neatly over Jaroslaw Fojut's sliding challenge and curled a low cross into the path of Obadeyi, who nutmegged his marker before jabbing past Cierzniak. 
 It was Eremenko who also supplied the delivery for the second, Connolly holding off Fojut to head home the Finn's corner. 
 United substitute Gary Mackay-Steven sent one effort over while Chris Erskine had a shot beaten away by Brennan. 
 However, it was Kilmarnock who came closest to adding to the scoring with Robbie Muirhead's wicked drive being turned over by Cierzniak.

157|||Kilmarnock goalkeeper Craig Samson faces weeks out of action after picking up a suspected broken toe in the 2-0 win over Dundee United. Kilmarnock: Craig Samson suffers suspected broken toe  Kilmarnock goalkeeper Craig Samson faces weeks out of action after picking up a suspected broken toe in the 2-0 win over Dundee United. 
 Manager Allan Johnston told BBC Scotland: &quot;It looks as though he broke his toe. He got quite a bad one.&quot; 
 The 30-year-old has been an ever-present this season since arriving from St Mirren. 
 But he was forced off at half-time at Rugby Park after a collision with United midfielder Stuart Armstrong. 
 &quot;Obviously we're disappointed to lose him,&quot; added Johnston, who brought on 20-year-old Conor Brennan, who arrived from Leicester City during the summer, at half-time. 
 &quot;He's been fantastic since he came in at the start of the season, but young Conor came in and did fantastically as well.&quot; 
 United had arrived two points clear of Hamilton Academical at the top of the Scottish Premiership and having won their last five games against Kilmarnock. 
 But goals from Tope Obadeyi and Mark Connolly within three second-half minutes lifted Kilmarnock above Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Celtic into third place. 
 &quot;They've got top players throughout their whole team, but we just showed what we're capable of and we've got to make sure we can do that week in, week out,&quot; said Johnston. 
 &quot;Sammy Clingan and Jamie Hamill were fantastic in the middle of the park. 
 &quot;They totally dominated the middle area and you had Josh Magennis, who was causing all sorts of problems up front for them.&quot; 
 Johnston was also pleased with his side's movement off the ball, crossing and creation of chances. 
 &quot;Obviously it was good to get the goals as well,&quot; he said. &quot;We deserved them, but we defended really well as well.&quot; 
 Asked if Kilmarnock could maintain their recent good form, the Kilmarnock manager added: &quot;It is going to be tough, but we've got the quality of players, so I'm sure if we work the way did today and the way we have the last few games, we'll not be far away. 
 &quot;We can't get complacent. We must remember the hard work that's got us here.&quot; ###
158|||Jackie McNamara admitted his Dundee United side had been beaten by the better side after watching Kilmarnock triumph at Rugby Park. Dundee Utd second best against Kilmarnock - Jackie McNamara  Jackie McNamara admitted his Dundee United side had been beaten by the better side after watching Kilmarnock triumph at Rugby Park. 
 The Scottish Premiership leaders lost 2-0 to the Ayrshire side and McNamara expressed frustration at his team's display. 
 &quot;There were too many that weren't at it tonight,&quot; he explained. 
 &quot;We were beaten by a bit more desire and willingness to chase lost causes and work hard for the team.&quot; 
 The Tangerines boss refused to use Kilmarnock's artificial surface as an excuse for United's performance. 
 &quot;It doesn't matter what pitch you're on,&quot; he said. 
 &quot;They should be confident, they should be wanting to go and express themselves properly. They [Kilmarnock] managed to get their full-backs forward at times, we didn't. 
 &quot;I know they're better than that and so far this season they've been up to everything that's been put to them. 
 &quot;Credit to Kilmarnock, they were confident here and you can see why they've done well at home. We got beaten by the better team tonight.&quot; 
 United front-man Nadir Ciftci tried to go straight up the tunnel after being replaced with Ola Adeyemo in the second half but was ordered back to the dugout area by McNamara. 
 &quot;I told him to sit down,&quot; said the manager of Ciftci. 
 &quot;It was a frustrating night for him. I don't think he was the only one that didn't perform for us.&quot; 
 United may yet go into the international break as Premiership pacesetters with second-place Hamilton Academical facing Celtic on Sunday and Inverness - a point behind Accies and three off United - taking on Ross County, also on Sunday. 
 &quot;The disappointing thing is that we've got to wait two weeks to get this out our system for the Partick Thistle game, but we need to do better than we did tonight,&quot; added McNamara. ###
159|||Tope Obadeyi wants to make Kilmarnock the same sort of "home" that captain Manuel Pascali has over the past six years. Kilmarnock: Tope Obadeyi eager to lay down roots at Rugby Park  Tope Obadeyi wants to make Kilmarnock the same sort of &quot;home&quot; that captain Manuel Pascali has over the past six years. 
 The English forward, 24, made Killie the ninth club of his career when he signed a three-year deal in the summer. 
 &quot;It's a proper family club and it's a real home now,&quot; Obadeyi told BBC Scotland. &quot;I'm showing that I'm enjoying my football now. 
 &quot;I say to him (Pascali) that he's Scottish more than Italian now.&quot; 
 Obadeyi goes into Friday's match at Dundee United on a high after bagging his second and third goals of the season against Partick Thistle - either side of a Pascali header. 
&quot;I thought Scotland was supposed to be cold!? Not complaining though.&quot;
 &quot;He's a leader on the pitch,&quot; said Obadeyi of the former Parma man. &quot;The way he plays and trains - he puts 110% into everything he does. 
 &quot;I've come here and everyone's been great with me. Hopefully I can get some consistency and push on and get myself in double figures, you never know. 
 &quot;We've got a great balance of experience and youth and it's shown with the results that we've picked up. 
 &quot;Dundee United are doing well, but we're doing well ourselves. Top six is the aim.&quot; 
 Obadeyi, who notched one goal in two England under-20 appearances in 2009, has failed to establish himself at clubs such as Bolton, Bury and Rio Ave of Portugal. 
 But, in Kilmarnock playmaker Alexei Eremenko, he sees someone who will help him get on the goal trail in Scotland, thereby helping him settle further. 
 &quot;Everyone can see that Alexei's got ability,&quot; added Obadeyi. 
 &quot;People say he's got eyes on the back of his head, with the way he finds people with passes. 
 &quot;You're definitely going to get chances when he's playing. Every time he gets the ball, Josh (Magennis) and I know to run forward as he's going to put it on a plate for you.&quot; ###
160|||Kallum Higginbotham will miss Partick Thistle's Scottish Premiership meeting with Motherwell and will go undergo knee surgery next week.  Date: Saturday, 4 October. Venue: Firhill Stadium, Glasgow. Kick-off: 15:00 BST.
Coverage: Updates on BBC Radio Scotland &amp; BBC Sport website.
 Kallum Higginbotham will miss Partick Thistle's Scottish Premiership meeting with Motherwell and will go undergo knee surgery next week. 
 The forward will be out for up to four months and Gary Fraser and Sean Welsh are also currently sidelined. 
 Steven Hammell, Keith Lasley, Iain Vigurs and Mark O'Brien are all back for Motherwell after injury. 
 But Jack Leitch, Paul Lawson and Craig Reid join long-term injury victim Craig Moore on the sidelines. 
 Stephen McManus has recovered from the knock that forced him off at half-time last weekend. 
  Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald:  &quot;As a manager you look at a team coming and usually you have an idea of what kind of team is going to play, but Stuart [McCall] has changed it totally in the last three games so I don't know. 
 &quot;Like us, they are struggling for consistency. They were used to having that last year but like ourselves they have a few players out and any team will struggle without having key players playing for you. 
 &quot;It is two teams coming off disappointing results and performances so I think you will see two teams having a go on Saturday.&quot; 
  Motherwell manager Stuart McCall:  &quot;We'll be looking for a reaction. We are always open and honest between the players and staff. They knew they let themselves down last week, let the supporters down, and as a group we let people down. 
 &quot;We now have to show that we have the spirit and determination and desire to bounce back, which we have done year after year after year. 
 &quot;I've watched it two or three times and it doesn't get any better, but we gave away two goals from individual errors and a dubious penalty. 
 &quot;We need to get over it and there is no better way than to go and win your next game. You always have another game.&quot; ###
161|||New signing James McFadden could make his St Johnstone debut against St Mirren.  Date: Saturday, 4 October. Venue: Firhill Stadium, Glasgow. Kick-off: 15:00 BST.
Coverage: Updates on BBC Radio Scotland &amp; BBC Sport website.
 New signing James McFadden could make his St Johnstone debut against St Mirren. 
 On-loan Brian Graham returns for Saints after sitting out last weekend's defeat to his parent club Dundee United, but Chris Millar is a doubt. 
 Adam Drury returns to the St Mirren squad after recovering from an ankle injury. 
 However, Jeroen Tesselaar, Ellis Plummer, Gary Teale, Isaac Osbourne and Steven Thompson remain out. 
  St Johnstone midfielder Simon Lappin:  &quot;I have known James [McFadden] since I was 13 years old when we were both playing for Motherwell's youth teams. 
 &quot;You could seen even then that he was a special talent and he's proved that with the career he's gone on to have, playing at the highest level with Scotland and down south in the Premiership. 
 &quot;Hopefully he can come in and do what he has been doing for the last 15 years, which is creating chances and scoring goals.&quot; 
  St Mirren defender Jim Goodwin:  &quot;St Johnstone are on a poor run in the league, they have lost their last three league games, so both of us are fighting for our lives at the moment. 
 &quot;It is always a difficult game there. They are well-organised team with top professionals.&quot; ###
162|||Strikers John Guidetti and Stefan Scepovic could return for Celtic's encounter with Hamilton on Sunday.  Date: Sunday, 5 October. Venue: Celtic Park, Glasgow. Kick-off: 13:00 BST.
Coverage: Commentary and updates BBC Sport website.
 Strikers John Guidetti and Stefan Scepovic could return for Celtic's encounter with Hamilton on Sunday. 
 Guidetti was ineligible for the Europa League win over Dinamo Zagreb, which Scepovic missed with a knock. 
 Charlie Mulgrew, Mikael Lustig and Adam Matthews are close to fitness but are unlikely to be risked, while James Forrest remains out. 
 Hamilton's Martin Canning will have a fitness test while Darian MacKinnon completes a four-match suspension. 
  Celtic defender Efe Ambrose:  &quot;The feeling is good because it's been quite a long time since we won a European game at home, so it brought back the winning mentality we used to have at Celtic Park. 
 &quot;It's been a difficult European campaign so we have started to improve. We are not there yet but we are working hard to get to the level the manager wants us to get. It will take a little bit of time, but we know he has a plan and his ambition for the club is good. 
 &quot;He is trying to bring a new style into our game, which is different for us, but every manager has his own game plan and tactics. 
 &quot;As players we just have to give him maximum co-operation, work hard in training and improve on every section of training, because that is where you learn and that is what you put into the game. 
 &quot;The most important thing is determination, how you prepare your body, staying away from injury and keeping fit. These are key points he is putting into us.&quot; 
  Hamilton Academical manager Alex Neil:  &quot;The fact Celtic are playing on Thursday will either make them change their team and freshen it up, which might give us an incentive, or their players could be fatigued. 
 &quot;We are looking for any bit of comfort we can get in terms of getting a slight advantage over Celtic. 
 &quot;We are going to Celtic park knowing we have to play to our maximum and hopefully we can get something from the game.&quot; ###
163|||Tom Ryder makes his first Glasgow Warriors start since February as coach Gregor Townsend continues his rotation policy against bottom-placed Treviso. Pro12: Benetton Treviso v Glasgow Warriors Venue: Stadio Monigo, Treviso Date: Sunday, 5 October Kick-off: 14:00 BST
Coverage: Live on BBC Two Scotland and BBC Sport website; live score updates on the BBC Sport website
 Tom Ryder makes his first Glasgow Warriors start since February as coach Gregor Townsend continues his rotation policy against bottom-placed Treviso. 
 The lock returned from injury to appear as a replacement in last week's 39-21 win over Connacht and is one of nine changes from that starting line-up. 
 Scrum-half Alberto Lucchese could make his debut for Treviso after returning to his hometown club in the summer. 
 The 28-year-old is on the Treviso bench after three years with Mogliano. 
&quot;We're expecting a big challenge in Treviso on Sunday afternoon and our defence will have to be at its best&quot;
 Glasgow, who sit second top of the Pro12 table on the same points as leaders Ospreys after four straight wins, could give debuts to two Scotland Under-20 internationals from the bench. 
 Zander Fagerson, an 18-year-old tight-head prop, and 21-year-old scrum-half Ali Price are named on the replacements' bench. 
 Townsend said: &quot;Zander's selection comes off the back of the way he's trained with us and played for Glasgow Hawks. 
 &quot;Ali has recovered well from his knee injury, which he had last season, and has been in cracking form for Stirling County. 
 &quot;Both players also played very well in the recent 'A' fixture against Edinburgh.&quot; 
 Hooker Pat MacArthur retains his place at Stadio Monigo on Sunday to make his 100th Warriors appearance, while Alex Allan and Rossouw de Klerk come in to partner him in the front row in place of Gordon Reid and Euan Murray. 
 Ryder replaces Tim Swinson, while James Eddie comes in for Rob Harley at blind-side flanker, Tyrone Holmes is recalled after suspension at open-side and Josh Strauss returns from injury at number eight, with Chris Fusaro and Adam Ashe dropping out. 
 Sean Lamont moves from the right wing to outside centre, with Tommy Seymour coming into the starting XV in place of Mark Bennett. 
 Peter Horne comes in at inside centre in place of James Downey, while Niko Matawalu returns from injury at scrum-half in place of Henry Pyrgos. 
 Treviso coach Umberto Casellato has introduced Matteo Muccignat into the front row in place of Matteo Zanusso following Sunday's 33-15 defeat by Newport Gwent Dragons in Wales. 
 In the backs, Angelo Esposito and Edoardo Gori come in for Andrea Pratichetti and James Ambrosini. 
 Treviso have yet to win a point from the opening four games of the season, but Townsend warned: &quot;We're expecting a big challenge in Treviso on Sunday afternoon and our defence will have to be at its best. 
 &quot;We've worked hard on this area in training and the players have tackled well this week.&quot; 
  Benetton Treviso:  Jayden Hayward, Angelo Esposito, Michele Campagnaro, Luca Morisi, Ludovico Nitoglia, Joe Carlisle, Edoardo Gori, Mat Luamanu, Marco Lazzaroni, Simone Favaro, Marco Fuser, Antonio Pavanello (captain), Rupert Harden, Davide Giazzon, Matteo Muccignat.  Replacements:  Giovanni Maistri, Matteo Zanusso, Romulo Acosta, Francesco Minto, Leo Auva'a, Marco Barbini, Sam Christie, Alberto Lucchese. 
  Glasgow Warriors:  Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour, Sean Lamont, Peter Horne, DTH van der Merwe, Duncan Weir, Niko Matawalu, Alex Allan, Pat MacArthur, Rossouw de Klerk, Tom Ryder, Al Kellock (captain), James Eddie, Tyrone Holmes, Josh Strauss.  Replacements:  Fraser Brown, Jerry Yanuyanutawa, Zander Fagerson, Leone Nakarawa, Chris Fusaro, Ali Price, Finn Russell, James Downey.

164|||Hamilton manager Alex Neil hopes his in-form side's free-flowing style will earn them a win over Celtic on Sunday. Hamilton Academical: Boss Alex Neil targets victory over Celtic  Hamilton manager Alex Neil hopes his in-form side's free-flowing style will earn them a win over Celtic on Sunday. 
 Accies go into the match second top of the Premiership after winning five of their eight games, including a 4-0 victory over local rivals Motherwell. 
 And player-boss Neil says his charges will be going for a victory. 
 &quot;We'll try to impose our game on Celtic, I'd be doing myself and the team a disservice if I tried to change that for any game,&quot; Neil said. 
 &quot;We won't be going to play for a draw. The team we have at the moment, we're not a gritty team that sit in and make it difficult, we're an expansive team that want to go and play, and we have great technical players. 
 &quot;Confidence is sky high and it doesn't get any better than beating your local rivals at their own place.&quot; 
&quot;The only way our players are going to get better is by trying to get the ball down and play good football. That's how you improve as a player - you're not going to improve by just getting it and banging it from back to front.&quot;
 Accies ended a two-year absence from Scotland's top flight when they won promotion last season with a play-off victory over Hibernian. 
 And they have already won as many games this term as they did in the entire 2010-11 campaign, when they were relegated. 
 Neil, 33, took over as player-manager in 2013 after the departure of Billy Reid, and he is committed to a passing style of football with his young side. 
 &quot;The players have adapted to what we've tried to do over the last year-and-a-bit,&quot; Neil told BBC Scotland. &quot;And a lot of them now have plenty of games under their belts and are showing their real potential at the top level of Scottish football. 
 &quot;We don't really set any goals. First and foremost we wanted to make sure we were going to compete in the league and now we have started so well, we want to try to maintain that for as long as we can. 
 &quot;The big thing for us is to go and try to win every game we play. We don't want to just settle for a draw or sitting in and making it difficult - we want to go and express ourselves. 
 &quot;The only way our players are going to get better is by trying to get the ball down and play good football. That's how you improve as a player - you're not going to improve by just getting it and banging it from back to front. 
 &quot;We want to play in the right manner but you have to get the balance right as we need to pick up as many points as we can.&quot; ###

166|||TODS MURRAY staff will be transferred after the acquisition by Shepherd and Wedderburn but proposals reveal 50 jobs could be at risk. 50 jobs at risk as law firm Tods Murray acquired by Shepherd and Wedderburn - Daily Record AROUND 50 jobs could be lost at a Scottish law firm which has been bought out of administration by another firm.
Shepherd and Wedderburn yesterday acquired the business and assets of Tods Murray, a 158-year-old firm, for an undisclosed sum.
All the 160 or so Tods Murray staff will be transferred with immediate effect.
Of the staff joining Shepherd and Wedderburn 18 will join as partners, five as directors and seven as consultants.
Employees were formally notified of the situation on Friday October 3 and a formal 45-day redundancy consultation with former Tods Murray staff is due to begin next week.
The initial proposal is for around 50 jobs to be subject to redundancy consultation.
Stephen Gibb, chief executive of Shepherd and Wedderburn, said: &quot;We will be welcoming many new colleagues into our team, as part of Shepherd and Wedderburn. Their clients can be assured of a continuation of the high level of service they have come to expect, as well as the opportunity to access the expanded range of legal expertise and advice we offer.
&quot;Whilst inevitably there will be a need to rationalise, I am confident that the arrangement will provide significant benefits to our staff and client base.
&quot;Shepherd and Wedderburn has a debt-free balance sheet and a strategy for sustainable growth both in Scotland and across the rest of the UK.
&quot;The opportunity to add to our excellent client base and secure additional high quality lawyers to bolster our expert teams is ideally timed for our business. It's a further significant step forward in realising our clearly defined strategy for growth&quot;.
Shepherd and Wedderburn will trade out of the former Tods Murray offices at Edinburgh Quay and Bothwell Street, Glasgow for no more than three months before these offices are closed.
After the consultation period all staff who are retained will move to Shepherd and Wedderburn's existing offices at Exchange Crescent, Edinburgh and West George Street, Glasgow.
The firm also has offices in London and Aberdeen and says it delivers &quot;comprehensive multi-jurisdictional legal advice across every business sector&quot; as well as offering the full range of private client and wealth management services.
After the acquisition the firm will have 564 staff, including 82 partners.
Lorna Jack, chief executive of the Law Society of Scotland, said: &quot;We are very sad to hear that Tods Murray has gone into administration. It represents the loss of a long established and very highly regarded Scottish law firm.
&quot;We are confident however that arrangements are being put in place to ensure that there is as little disruption as possible to the firm's clients as there is to be a full transfer of business to Shepherd and Wedderburn, one of Scotland's largest law firms.
&quot;While all Tods Murray staff will also transfer to Shepherd and Wedderburn, we are very aware that this will be a difficult and uncertain time for everyone affected by today's announcement. We already have a range of support services available to solicitors for these kinds of situations and we will be offering our help and support to those who need it.&quot;
She added: &quot;Law firms were hit hard by the recession which, combined with the ongoing, significant changes within the legal services sector, is continuing to have an impact. While the profession overall has been robust in weathering the downturn, today's announcement shows that we cannot take things for granted, even as the economy shows signs of recovery.&quot;

167|||NICK Hedges' collection of black and white photos taken in tenement areas like the Gorbals and Maryhill highlight the decrepit living conditions in 1970. Haunting images of Glasgow slum reveal ghosts of poverty for first time in photo exhibition - Daily Record THESE heartbreaking, shocking photos of urban poverty in Glasgow look like something out of a Dickens novel but were taken less than 50 years ago.
They depict slum-like conditions in tenements from areas like the Gorbals and Maryhill, where families faced rat-infested homes, damp walls and demolition gangs moving in without a moment’s notice.
The photographs were taken in 1970 by acclaimed snapper Nick Hedges for homelessness charity Shelter but have only just been released to the public thanks to a new exhibition launching in London this week.
The Make Life Worth Living display at the Science Museum has been launched by Shelter to show how many areas in the UK have been regenerated in the past 40 years, but also to highlight how many people still struggle in poverty in the 21st century.

Nick said: “Although these photographs have become historical documents, they serve to remind us that secure and adequate housing is the basis of a civilised urban society.
“The failure of successive governments to provide it is a sad mark of society’s inaction. The photographsshould allow us to celebrate progress, yet all they can do is haunt us with a sense of failure.”
Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb said: “Nick’s pictures were crucial to the early days of Shelter’s campaigning, capturing a stark reality that many people in Britain couldn’t even imagine, let alone believe, was happening in their community.
“Many of the scenes that Nick captured are from places that have long since been regenerated but conditions not a million miles from these exist in our communities even now, with poor housing, sky-high house prices, rogue landlords and a housing safety net that’s being cut to shreds, leading three million people to turn to Shelter each year.
 

“It’s nearly 50 years since these pictures were taken and the Shelter journey began. I truly hope in another 50 years, our journey will have long been completed and that bad housing and homelessness will be a thing of the past rather than a challenge for our future.”
Nick spent three years travelling around areas of deprivation all across the UK to create this significant body of work reflecting the distressing reality of housing for many. He gave 1000 of his prints to the National Media Museum in 1983 but until now their use has been restricted to protect the privacy of his subjects.
Make Life Worth Living: Nick Hedges’ Photographs for Shelter, 1968-72 will run until January 18 next year in the Virgin Media Studio, Media Space, Science Museum, London. Full details at www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/makelifeworthliving

168|||RECORD VIEW applauds the bravery of Carol-Anne Napier in waiving her right to anonymity after months of sickening sexual and physical attacks at the hands of sex beast Robert Dewar. Record View: Bravery of Carol-Anne Napier waiving anonymity should give strength to other rape victims coming forward - Record View - Daily Record CAROL-Anne Napier may be the bravest woman in Scotland.
The mum of four waived her anonymity to open up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of sex beast Robert Dewar.
Her story of months of repeated rapes, beatings, humiliation and degradation will horrify ever reader.
And, equally, her courage in coming forward to encourage other rape victims to seek help will be an inspiration to thousands.
Carol-Anne, from Lochgelly in Fife, feels guilty that she did not come forward sooner.
She is worried she could have prevented some of Dewar’s later victims being attacked. But she has nothing to feel guilty about.
There is only one person responsible for Dewar’s sickening crimes – Dewar.
The systematic abuse and rape he subjected Carol-Anne to is unimaginable.
She should be extremely proud that she has found the strength to speak out to give victims hope and to warn rapists that they will not be allowed to act with impunity.
Times have changed and the police and the courts have progressed in dealing with sex assault victims. But there is still work to do.
Only 17 per cent of women who go to Rape Crisis report the attack to police.
Women across Scotland can take confidence from Carol-Anne’s story that if they find themselves in a similar situation, they can contact the authorities and get help.
That is the only way to ensure vile scum like Dewar are locked up.
GEORGE Ferrier showed the true spirit of Scotland when he took on axe-wielding robbers.
He disregarded his own safety when he tackled the Arygll Arcade jewel heist gang.
Even after the thugs beat security guard George to the ground, he got back on his feet, replaced his top hat and got on with the job of keeping shoppers safe.
He showed that there are still brave people out there who put others before themselves.
It is people like George who strike fear into those who would harm us.
The criminals want us scared, alone, unable to respond. Walking on by. Looking the other way. Ignoring those in need. That is how evil prospers.
In these troubled times, it is people like George who restore our faith in human nature.
The Daily Record salutes you.
IT looks like winter is here after the summer that refused to end.
Rain and wind is set to sweep the country today, bringing a chilly feel.
So if you need a bit of cheering up, come along to cheer on those taking part in the Great Scottish Run tomorrow in Glasgow.
Runners raising millions for worthy causes will bring a bit of sunshine into your life.

169|||Paisley woman Laura Haveron is due to fly to Namibia on Monday, having spent two years preparing for the adventure. Fundraiser Laura devastated after losing passport just days before setting off for African charity trek - Daily Record A heartbroken florist’s dream trip to Africa to take part in a charity trek was in tatters...after she lost her passport during a shopping expedition.
Paisley woman Laura Haveron is due to fly to Namibia on Monday, having spent two years preparing for the adventure.
However, she has been left grounded by her shopping mishap – and her only hope is that someone finds the missing passport within the next 72 hours.
Laura, 26, told the Paisley Daily Express: “I’m absolutely gutted.
“I was in tears when I realised I’d lost my passport.
“I’d been so looking forward to going to Africa for the charity trek but losing my passport has killed my dream.
“All I can do is plead for help to find it.
“I’ve been preparing for the charity challenge for two years but, unless my passport turns up, it will all be ruined.”
Laura, of Castle Gait, lost the passport while she was out shopping on Monday.
She had visited shops in George Street and Paisley town centre before moving on to Renfrew, and her heart sank when she got out of her car and discovered her passport was gone.
Laura, who signed up for the 100-mile African trek to raise cash for a cancer charity, contacted the Passport Office in Glasgow, in the hope they could issue a replacement as an emergency measure, but has been left disappointed.
She said: “I was told it would take at least a week to get a replacement because it is classed as a lost passport but that will be too late for me to travel to Africa.
“I’m due to take part in a trek through the Namib Desert in aid of the Michelle Henderson Cervical Cancer Trust and have been training hard for it – working at the gym and running outdoors.
“My cousin and I have raised more than &pound;4,000 for the charity through various activities, including a climb up Ben Lomond in preparation for the trek, so I’d be devastated to miss out now.”
Michelle Henderson who was the daughter of Rangers legend Willie Henderson, died at the age of just 28 from cervical cancer.
 

Laura, who was set to join Willie on the trip to Namibia, has also been in touch with the police, in the hope someone had handed her passport to them, but had no luck there either.
She added: “I’d be so grateful if someone was able to come to the rescue by finding my passport.”

170|||ETHIOPIAN legend Haile Gebrselassie will join more than 30,000 runners of all abilities for a weekend of running, culminating in the 10K and half-marathon on Sunday morning. Great Scottish Run rounds off greatest sporting year in Scotland's history with race for runners of all abilities - Daily Record IT’S been the biggest sporting year in Scotland’s history.
And the excitement isn’t over as the biggest names in distance running arrive for the Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run.
Ethiopian legend Haile &shy;Gebrselassie returns to Glasgow today to join more than 30,000 runners taking part in a weekend festival of running, culminating in the 10K and half-marathon tomorrow morning.
The 41-year-old double Olympic champion will join a field of fancy dress enthusiasts, fundraisers and competitive sportsmen and women.
The Daily Record and Sunday Mail will again be at the heart of the action, with special events and attractions at the line for the brave finishers, as well as a day of fun activities at our offices on the course.
The Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run is the country’s biggest mass participation running event.
A line-up of athletes of all ages and abilities will leave George Square in the half-marathon at 11am on Sunday, heading across the Clyde over the Kingston Bridge, through &shy;Bellahouston and Pollok parks then back to the city centre across the Clyde Arc “squinty bridge”, past the Record offices and, after 13.1 miles, towards the finish at Glasgow Green.
The 10k takes in a modified version of the same route, leaving George Square at 9.30am.
The star attraction of the event, sponsored by Bank of Scotland, Daily Record and Sunday Mail , Puma, Clyde 1 FM, Virgin Trains, Lucozade Sport and Strathmore Water, will be Gebrselassie, widely regarded as one of the best distance runners ever to grace the sport.
 

He won last year’s race in 61 minutes and 9 seconds, the fastest time ever in Scotland for a half-marathon and a world age-group record.
He said: “I have fantastic &shy;memories of my first race in &shy;Scotland and I am delighted to be coming back.
“It’s a great race with a great atmosphere and the &shy;organisation is superb.”
Other elite athletes include Commonwealth silver medallist Stephen Chemlany, from Kenya, and Team Scotland’s Hayley Hennings, Joasia &shy;Zakrzewski Susan Partridge – who won the women’s race last year.
Commonwealth gold medallist Michael Shelley and London 2012 marathon gold medallist Tiki Gelana will also be running, as will Kenyan London marathon winner Edna Kiplagat.
Scots comedian, presenter and Record columnist Des Clarke will host the Sunday Mail’s &shy;Motivational Mile, on Broomielaw next to our offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Commonwealth champion Michael Shelley&nbsp; is aiming for dream double ahead of the event in Glasgow 
Des, who hosted the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in August and the Ryder Cup Gala concert last month, said: “I’ll be there from the race starting off and my job is to help everyone over the line near the end.
“We’ll have music and a great celebration of everyone in good spirits and make sure we’ll have the people of Glasgow lining the streets to cheer for them.
“All week I’ve been practising my high fives – last year, it was amazing how many people came up for a high five, and I tell you what, they speed up for it. I think I’m responsible for a few personal bests.
“I’m also the reason Haile Gebrselassie is back again because in the final stretch, he was gonna come over for a high five but unfortunately he missed it – he just wasn’t fast enough for me.”

171|||THIS newly-launched restaurant in the southside of Glasgow offers authentic Italian dishes at friendly prices. Gary Ralston's restaurant review: Michaelangelo's, 9 Helena Place, Busby Road, Clarkston - Daily Record IT was a restaurant referendum always destined to end with a yes vote. When Roma Mia in Pollokshields closed its doors last year, it left a big hole in the dining scene of the southside of Glasgow.
Apparently, there was a dispute with the landlord – he had only ever rented the place out as a two-bedroom flat.
Seriously, Roma Mia had earned its reputation for culinary excellence over 15 years and a loyal army of diners held its collective breath for a reinvention elsewhere in the city.
Father and son team Massimo and Michael Onorati weighed up their options and decided to strike out together again after finding new premises at Clarkston Toll.
Judging by our recent lunchtime experience, the restaurant is already thriving, despite being opened less than a month.
A point of interest – it’s named Michaelangelo’s because it’s Michael’s full Christian name, not&nbsp;in honour of the famous Italian sculptor Michelangelo, creator of the fabled artwork at the&nbsp;Sistine Chapel.
That didn’t half come as a relief to the guy who was hired to Artex the ceiling.
My big pal Tam, a Tartan Army stalwart and passionate advocate for independence, needed cheering after September 18 as not even the signed picture of Nicola Sturgeon on his bedroom wall is helping him through.
However, the menu at Michaelangelo’s certainly raised a smile – not to mention the budget-friendly prices.
A three-course lunch will set you back only &pound;9.95, with the pre-theatre deal at &pound;10.95. Those impressive financial figures could not be manipulated anything but positively by spin doctors of all political hues.
Inevitably, so early in its rebirth, there are still challenges for Michaelangelo’s to overcome, but if it’s accepting a queue, it’s open to review.
The interior, after an extensive refit, is smart and contemporary and over time the smell of new paint and sanded wood will give way to the aroma of freshly baked bread and bubbling pasta sauces.
Likewise, the magnolia walls could do with a splash of colour, a picture here and there to liven up a dining room that, understandably, is still carrying the look of a show home.
The service was also a little disjointed – it seemed, in part, due to the kitchen being overwhelmed by orders after a steady stream of lunchtime arrivals.
It left us on the brink of shifting uncomfortably in our&nbsp;seats over the length of the&nbsp;gap between starters and main courses but the food arrived just as we were considering raising a finger to&nbsp;make the point.
Michaelangelo’s may take another couple of weeks to find its servicing stride but they have already hit the ground running in terms of the quality of the food.
Fresh, simple ingredients are key – homemade meatballs, potato dumplings, ravioli, pizzas, risottos. There is an impressive selection of meat and fish dishes, although not so many to suggest the chef is on first name terms with his deep freezer.
Tam and I chopped and changed between the lunchtime and a la carte menus – better together, I suggested, which only brought&nbsp;a scoff, although his demeanour quickly improved&nbsp;with the arrival of the minestrone soup.
It was piping hot and packed with colour and flavour, with slices of rustic Italian bread to help mop up the thick vegetable broth.
 

My antipasto Italiano came on a wooden serving board and was laden with cured meats, buffalo mozzarella, olives and grilled vegetables and was bursting with taste and smashing value as part of the lunchtime deal.
The wait for the main courses was worth it as Tam went for the Marcuccio calzoni, named in honour of Michael’s brother (his sister Penne is also well represented on the menu). The calzoni was the size of a hotel pillow, with the dough crispy on top and the perfect chewy texture round the edges and, when punctured, it released a mouthwatering aromatic cloud of Italian meats and cheese.
My seafood salad was also top notch – simply cooked and presented, packed with the flavours of plump prawns and mussels atop a bed of lettuce with chunks of smoked mackerel and calamari.
The lunchtime crowd thinning, we held on for a couple of coffees and chewed the cud over our vision of Scotland in another decade’s time.
Socialist or SNP, independent or still in bed with the rest of the UK, who can tell?
However, at Michaelangelo’s, you can bet the teething issues and whiff of paint will have long since been replaced by the sweet smell of success.
Last week, Gary visited Locanda De Gusti, which impressed him with the cuisine and the service.

Athletes lead the charge for Super Saturday run A record breaking runner and stars of the Commonwealth and Olympic Games led the charge for thousands of children and families on the opening day of the Great Scottish Run.Over 3,000 people took part in Super Saturday, in which young runners take part in Scotland's biggest mass participation event.The 2.5k Junior Run for children aged 9-15 was started by record breaking Ethiopian long-distance runner Haile Gebrselassie, and Commonwealth Games gold and bronze medal-winning swimmer Ross Murdoch.The event included young club runners from around Scotland with Lily Evans-Haggerty winning junior girls (9-11), Ethan McGlen clinching the junior boys (9-11) top spot, Laura Stark coming in first in the junior girls (12-15) and Jamie MacKinnon winning the junior boys (12-15).The wheelchair junior event was won by Kyle Brotherton, who also took the same top place in last month's Great North Run.Commonwealth Games marathon winner Michael Shelley sent off the family mile along with Mr Murdoch, while London 2012 Olympic marathon winner Tiki Gelana and two-time World Champion Marathon runner Edna Kiplagat started the Toddler Dash.Andy Mitchelmore from Nova International, organisers of the Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run, said: &quot;Super Saturday gives younger runners the chance to be part of Scotland's biggest running event. To have over 3,000 run with us today is fantastic.&quot;The square was absolutely buzzing and I'm sure seeing elite athletes like Haile Gebrselassie, Michael Shelley, Tiki Gelana and Edna Kiplagat will have inspired the children to continue running and hopefully follow on to the 10k and Half Marathon events in years to come.

173|||AROUND 50 jobs could be lost at a Scottish law firm which has been bought out of administration by another firm Jobs to go after law firm acquisition AROUND 50 jobs could be lost at a Scottish law firm which has been bought out of administration by another firm.

Shepherd and Wedderburn yesterday acquired the business and assets of Tods Murray, a 158-year-old firm, for an undisclosed sum.
All the 160 or so Tods Murray staff will be transferred with immediate effect.
Of the staff joining Shepherd and Wedderburn 18 will join as partners, five as directors and seven as consultants.
Employees were formally notified of the situation on Friday October 3 and a formal 45-day redundancy consultation with former Tods Murray staff is due to begin next week.
The initial proposal is for around 50 jobs to be subject to redundancy consultation.
Stephen Gibb, chief executive of Shepherd and Wedderburn, said: “We will be welcoming many new colleagues into our team, as part of Shepherd and Wedderburn. Their clients can be assured of a continuation of the high level of service they have come to expect, as well as the opportunity to access the expanded range of legal expertise and advice we offer.
“Whilst inevitably there will be a need to rationalise, I am confident that the arrangement will provide significant benefits to our staff and client base.
“Shepherd and Wedderburn has a debt-free balance sheet and a strategy for sustainable growth both in Scotland and across the rest of the UK.
“The opportunity to add to our excellent client base and secure additional high quality lawyers to bolster our expert teams is ideally timed for our business. It’s a further significant step forward in realising our clearly defined strategy for growth”.
Shepherd and Wedderburn will trade out of the former Tods Murray offices at Edinburgh Quay and Bothwell Street, Glasgow for no more than three months before these offices are closed.
After the consultation period all staff who are retained will move to Shepherd and Wedderburn’s existing offices at Exchange Crescent, Edinburgh and West George Street, Glasgow.
The firm also has offices in London and Aberdeen and says it delivers “comprehensive multi-jurisdictional legal advice across every business sector” as well as offering the full range of private client and wealth management services.
After the acquisition the firm will have 564 staff, including 82 partners.
Lorna Jack, chief executive of the Law Society of Scotland, said: “We are very sad to hear that Tods Murray has gone into administration. It represents the loss of a long established and very highly regarded Scottish law firm.
“We are confident however that arrangements are being put in place to ensure that there is as little disruption as possible to the firm’s clients as there is to be a full transfer of business to Shepherd and Wedderburn, one of Scotland’s largest law firms.
“While all Tods Murray staff will also transfer to Shepherd and Wedderburn, we are very aware that this will be a difficult and uncertain time for everyone affected by today’s announcement. We already have a range of support services available to solicitors for these kinds of situations and we will be offering our help and support to those who need it.”
She added: “Law firms were hit hard by the recession which, combined with the ongoing, significant changes within the legal services sector, is continuing to have an impact. While the profession overall has been robust in weathering the downturn, today’s announcement shows that we cannot take things for granted, even as the economy shows signs of recovery.”

174|||RICHARD Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, is preparing to carry out the womb transplant operation next year. Scots doctor set to make history by performing Britain's first ever womb transplant for infertile women - Daily Record A SCOTS doctor yesterday revealed he will perform Britain’s first womb transplant for infertile women next year.
The move follows revelations on Friday that a boy was born in Gothenberg, Sweden, after the world’s first successful transplant.
Richard Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon at Queen Charlotte’s Hospital in London, says he is now preparing to do a similar operation here next year.
The procedure will be funded by the Womb Transplant UK charity.
Sixty women in Britain are on a waiting list for the operation.
Last month’s birth in Sweden was only revealed by doctors on Friday night.
Both the baby and his 36-year-old mother are in good health.
Smith, who comes from Glasgow, said the revolutionary surgery could become as popular as surrogacy among infertile women.
Talking of the Swedish birth, he said: “This is brilliant. It looks like everything has gone very well and it’s really wonderful news. What’s happened here is so exciting because the great unknown has been answered.
“We’ve finished all the lab research and pre-transplant human research and we’re almost ready to go.
“The only big issue is we’re short of funds, which we’ve been all the way along.
“We’re submitting applications for ethics approval in the next few weeks with a view to doing human live transplants in the UK next year. We’ve moved from an atmosphere where people were really quite against this procedure to where people are quite supportive.
“We have 60 patients on the waiting list for this procedure.”
Smith also congratulated the Swedish doctors who performed the pioneering operation nine months ago.
He added: “It would reduce the demand for surrogacy. However, there are still plenty of women who’ll prefer to go down that route and avoid major surgery.
“But there are many, many women who would prefer to carry a baby themselves.
“There’s also a bit of a legal minefield around surrogacy and to avoid that and have their own baby is incredibly important for some women.”
Doctors in Gothenberg used the wombs of six women for the transplant.
The baby boy was born in perfect health, despite being two months premature.
His mum was born without a womb. She carried her baby in the womb of a 61-year-old woman. The baby, whose arrival has remained secret until now, was born by Caesarean section.
Project leader professor Mats Brannstrom, of Gothenburg University, said: “The baby screamed right away and has not required any care other than normal clinical observation at the neonatal unit. He weighed just under 4lb and although this may seem small, it’s normal for a baby so premature.”
The world’s first womb transplant was in Saudi Arabia in 2000 but the woman’s body rejected it after four months.

Both events began in George Square, with a course featuring famous venues from this summer's Commonwealth Games as well as crossing the River Clyde, through two of Glasgow's best-kept parks, before heading back for the grandstand finish on Glasgow Green.

 

The 10K course is a shorter adaptation of the half marathon, weaving back and forth across the River Clyde.

182|||THE Sunday Mail can reveal that Police Scotland have refused to rule out links with a robbery at McGowans jewellers in Bearsden in April. Armed thugs who robbed Glasgow jewellery arcade may have performed similar siege six months earlier - Daily Record THE armed gang who robbed a busy jewellery arcade may have performed a similar raid six months earlier.
The four-man team, brandishing hammers and axes, escaped with 18 watches worth &pound;198,001 from Rox jewellers in Argyll Arcade , Glasgow, by smashing the front display window.
We can reveal that Police Scotland have refused to rule out links with a robbery at McGowans jewellers in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, in April.
Their shop window was also smashed and a quantity of rings and bracelets were taken by two masked men.
Police Scotland described the crime as a “high value” theft but no exact figure was given.
It is thought the raiders escaped in a white Nissan 4x4 car.
No one has been arrested in connection with the robbery.

One theory is that the raids might be one of a series of armed robberies being committed by small-time dealers who have run up debts with drug barons.
A Police Scotland spokesman said of the McGowans robbery: “We are looking at all possible lines of inquiry.”
The Argyll Arcade raid happened on September 24 .
The gang failed in bids to rob Mappin and Webb, Laing and Lewis Grant stores.
They were foiled when a Laing worker pressed a panic button and activated a smoke system which took just seconds to disorientate the raiders and frighten them off.

The scene was so dramatic that shoppers thought the gang had launched an attack using smoke bombs.
Their getaway car, a white Volkswagen Golf dumped in the nearby Townhead area, had been stolen in Haddington, East Lothian, more than 60 miles away.
They then made off in a second vehicle, a Vauxhall Combo van, and headed east on the M8.
Three Hublot watches worth &pound;31,600 were also damaged in the raid.
Last week the Sunday Mail published exclusive footage of the 54-second heist.

CCTV stills from inside the mall shows one woman – pushing a baby in a buggy – fleeing in terror as a thug smashes a hammer into a guard’s legs. The footage also shows the brave man, dressed in the arcade’s traditional uniform complete with top hat, giving chase in a bid to stop the thugs.
The video then captures terrified shoppers fleeing as the gang continue their raid . Around 50 seconds later, the four robbers come back into the frame as they make their escape.
In other video footage taken of the raid, one gang member is heard saying: “Out the way or I will kill you all.”###

Amunai Hobbs, 41, also known as Amunai Nicholson, left her home in Oban on Wednesday to catch a flight to Thailand.
She left Glasgow Airport the following day to attend Royal Alexandra Hospital reporting that she felt unwell, and there have been no confirmed sightings of her since she left the hospital at around 10.35am.
However, one report has placed her on Inchinnan Road, near Fleming Street, between 11.30am and 12.30pm.
The person who made the report stated that they don’t believe that she was wearing any shoes, Police said.
Ms Hobbs is from Thailand but lives in Scotland. She is described as around 4ft 10 inches in height and of slim build with short black hair. When last seen she was wearing a beige coloured fur coat, a purple dress with staining down the front, purple leggings and brown boots.
She was reported on Inchinnan Road wearing a grey cardigan with large buttons on the front, black cropped leggings and no shoes.
Inspector Gary Noonan, of Paisley Police Office, said: “Searches are continuing using a number of resources including the force helicopter and specialist search officers, however we have yet to trace Amunai.
“This is a very distressing time for her family and friends and they are extremely concerned for her wellbeing and safety. It is out of character for her not to keep in contact with them.
“I would urge anyone with any information on her whereabouts, or has seen someone matching her description to contact Paisley Police Office on 101.”###

187|||PETER Moore is facing life in prison for fatally stabbing his younger brother Derek in a fight at their mum's house in January - but in an exclusive interview April says can't bring herself to hate her vicious murderer son. I won't desert son who killed his own brother: Grief-stricken mum opens her heart on horror night her family was torn apart - Daily Record A HEARTBROKEN mother has told how her family was torn apart when her son murdered his brother – but insisted she won’t abandon the killer.
Peter Moore is facing life in jail after fatally stabbing his younger sibling Derek during a vicious fight.
Yesterday, their mum April broke her silence about the night her world came crashing down.
She said she will never forgive Peter but can’t bring herself to hate him.
In an exclusive interview with the Daily Record, the 55-year-old said: “I will forever miss my son Derek and it will take me a long time to even speak to Peter again.
“This has torn our family apart and broken my heart. But I am his mother and I will not desert him.”
Peter, 28, and Derek, 26, were at their mum’s home in Govan, Glasgow , when the violent row broke out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
April was staying at a friend’s house on the fateful night of January 3 and the first she knew about it was when she received a frantic call.
She said: “I’d recently moved into a new flat and my five kids had come to stay for a big family Christmas.
“After the most amazing few days together, I went to stay over with a friend and left Peter and Derek in my house with Peter’s kids.
“I got a text from Peter’s girlfriend Ashley early in the evening saying that the kids were tucked up and everyone was heading off to bed.
“But then at 1.40am, I had a call from my friend screaming down the phone, telling me to get home quickly as Peter and Derek were fighting.
“My blood ran cold and I jumped in my car and got to the house as quickly as I could.
“I didn’t have a clue what they would be fighting over – everyone had got on so well over Christmas and New Year.”
 

As April raced to the scene, Derek had already lost his fight for life.
He had been stabbed four times by his brother and suffered 75 injuries.
A court heard the fatal wound, which caused massive internal bleeding, was to Derek’s abdomen.
April was joined outside her upper tenement flat by Peter’s partner Ashley Picken, 24, who had taken her children to a family friend’s house nearby after she was woken up by the row.
April said: “As I looked up, I saw Peter standing at my living room window.
 “Ashley raced upstairs to see if he was OK. But when she came out again, she was white and said, ‘I’m sorry, April, I can’t find a pulse on Derek, he’s dead.’ I just stood there, I couldn’t go up and with those words my heart just shattered into pieces. 
“When Ashley said the word ‘dead’, my knees went from under me.”
 

After police arrived, April watched in shock as officers led Peter away in handcuffs, charged with his brother’s murder.
And the brutal way in which he killed Derek just added to her horror.
Breaking down in tears, April revealed to the Record that Derek’s throat had been slit and that he had been knifed in the eye, fracturing his eye socket.
His body was then dragged out of her home and down a set of stairs to the landing.
April said: “I knew Peter had a bad temper but I never imagined he was capable of something like this.
“Everything was a blur but the police arrived and then an ambulance.
“At one point, my grandson turned to me and said, ‘Nana, uncle Derek is in heaven. Daddy killed uncle Derek.
“I had to go and identify Derek’s body and his handsome face was covered in little cuts.
“Then I saw his throat had been slit and there was a deep wound from the knife to his eye that had fractured his eye socket – and the brutality of that shocked me even more.
“When I got back into my house, there were bloody drag marks, where Peter had moved Derek’s body out to the landing.
“He had been in bed, so was only wearing boxers, and I couldn’t get the image of him lying in the cold on a January night out there alone.
“The whole thing was surreal. I was devastated but I couldn’t get my head around the fact that Derek was gone because of Peter.”
 Dad-of-two Peter, from Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, denied murdering his brother and claimed dad-of-one Derek had started the fight. 
During the trial at the High Court in Glasgow, jurors heard that on a previous occasion Derek had broken his brother’s jaw.
Ashley told the court how she was woken up by the sound of the brothers arguing and fighting.
She told prosecutor Paul Kearney: “I looked out into the hallway and I saw Peter standing over Derek with a knife in his hand hitting Derek.
“He was hitting Derek in the legs and the side of his body with the knife.
“Derek was lying down on the floor on his back.”
Peter didn’t give evidence during the trial.
But at an earlier police interview, he told detectives: “When we fight, we fight for hours.
“I can’t remember arguing with him. He’s pure evil when he’s been drinking. He started it.”
But the jury rejected his claims and last month he was found guilty of murder.
April, who is also mum to David, 33, Pauline, 31, and Mark, 26, said: “Before the trial, I begged Peter to plead guilty, because I knew he had done it.
“But because he didn’t, I had to hear all sorts of things in court that I didn’t know – especially his previous convictions.”
She added: “When they were young, they would fight like normal boys. But as they got older they would still physically fight.
“They fought growing up, like all boys did, but they were also the best of pals.
“They were close; they were very alike. They just couldn’t drink together – and that is what happened that night.
“I think it was the cocktail of alcohol and drugs that I later found out Peter had taken that sent him over the edge and I think he must have just lost it.
“No one has any idea what they were arguing over. No one can imagine what happened to lead to that.”
Judge Lady Wolffe will sentence Moore next month.###

189|||HOLLYWOOD actors and star athletes were among the field as thousands took to the streets for the Great Scottish Run in Glasgow on Sunday. Great Scottish Run 2014: Movie stars and Olympians among 30,000 runners to pound streets of Glasgow for good cause - Daily Record MOVIE stars, Olympians and telly favourites were among 30,000 people pounding the streets for this year’s Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run.
Huge crowds gathered to cheer on the athletes in the 10k and half-marathon races through the streets of Glasgow.
South African Stephen Mokoka was first in the 13-mile main event and was cheered over the line at Glasgow Green, clocking up a time of 61 minutes and 25 seconds.
He said: “I’m really happy about my performance.
“When I left South Africa I was looking for a time of around 61 minutes, so I’m very happy about the outcome.
“It’s my second fastest half-marathon time.”
Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat, 34, won the women’s half-marathon, with a time of 67 minutes 57 seconds.
She said: “It’s one of the best courses I’ve ever run – flat, with small hills.
“I’d like to come back to defend my title next year.”
Scots Hollywood actress Shauna Macdonald, 33, star of Filth and The Descent, and Mr Selfridge actor hubbie Cal MacAninch, 50, were among the famous faces taking part.
Cal said: “It was great, running through Pollok Park reminded me of being back at school in Glasgow in the 70s.
“We used to do cross-country running there, we even managed to come third one year and beat the big muscle-bound boys from all the private schools.”
The couple were joined by Emmerdale star Chris Chittell, 66, who plays Eric Pollard in the soap and took on the morning 10k.
He explained: “I’ve been up for the run a couple of times and it’s always fun.
“It stayed dry for us and we managed to raise some money for Leukaemia And Lymphoma Research, it’s a great cause.”
Former Commonwealth, World and European champion swimmer Alison Sheppard, 41, swapped the pool for the pavement in the big race.
She said: “The support around the route was amazing, they were really getting behind everybody.”
Last year’s half-marathon champion, legendary Kenyan distance runner, Haile Gebrselassie, hoped to take home the title but was forced to drop out through injury.
The 41-year-old was in contention but stepped off the track around three miles in after suffering an asthma attack.
He explained: “I was struggling as bit with my breathing.
“What can you do?”
Veteran runner Tommy Armstrong took on the 10k challenge for Cancer Research.
Dressed as clown, the 73-year-old carried a bucket, which was full of donations by the time he reached the finished line.
He said: “I’ve been doing this every year since 1984.
“I’ve run it as a marathon and a half-marathon, but now I do the 10k because my knees aren’t as good as they used to be.
“I always try and come in last because the extra time lets me collect more money in my bucket.”
The 10k was won by Sean Fontana, of Glasgow’s Victoria Park AAC, in an amazing 31 minutes and three seconds, with the women’s title clinched by Edinburgh Athletic Club’s Laura Dunn in 35 minutes 17 seconds.
The top prize in the wheelchair race was clinched by Simon Lawson, of Carlisle Tri Club, in 23 minutes 39 seconds, while Jade Jones, of New Marske Harriers AC, bagged the top spot in the ladies’ race, in 29 minutes and 10 seconds.
The 10k started at George Square and passed landmarks, including the Hydro and Finnieston Crane, while the half-marathon passed through both Pollok and Bellahouston Park.
Billed as Scotland’s biggest mass participation event, the run also included children’s and family challenges, with more than 3,000 people taking part on Saturday.
APART from the obvious abject pain, I wasn’t sure what to expect from my first Great Scottish Run half marathon.
And while I can report that the experience more than delivered on the agony, I would honestly recommend anyone who feels they could run, jog or hobble their way around the 13 mile course to give it a try.
High on the adrenaline rush of actually competing in a mass spectator event I tore out of the blocks at George Square with thousands of other runners, feeling sure I’d pass defending champion Haile Gebrselassie before reaching the Kingston Bridge.
The two mile, then three mile markers flew by with barely the need to move out of first gear.
By four miles things were beginning to feel a little tougher, but as I banked into Pollok Park to the sound of bagpipes, I felt sure this was just a blip before my second wind kicked in.
At five miles I was gasping for breath, pain shooting through my knees, cramp sending my calfs and thighs into seizure.
By the time I reached Bellahouston Park I had been reduced to a hobbling wreck, and that pretty much continued until I crossed the finish.
The thing about the Great Scottish Run however, is that it is much more a celebration of life than anything particularly to do with running.
To pound through the streets of your home town with thousands of others, many running for charity in honour of dead loved ones, is a special thing.
Every step of the way the people of Glasgow are there for you, lining each mile of the course to cheer and support with everything they have.
Many offered drinks, cereal bars and even jelly babies to competitors who looked like they needed a helping hand.
By the time we reached Glasgow Green I doubt I’d have been able to stagger the final few metres had it not been for the incredible support of the thousands who had turned out on a grey Sunday morning to roar us over the line.
My finish time was way in excess of my two hour target, but the experience was one I will never forget.
I doubt I’m the only runner who felt they learned not just a little bit more about themselves, but also about the generous spirit of the people of Glasgow.###

Pay-to-park plan for car owners in Govan to beat flood of hospital drivers DRIVERS could be forced to pay to park outside their own homes when a new high-rise hospital opens.The council is considering a West End-style controlled parking scheme for the Govan area which is expected to cost each householder &pound;50 a year.The new &pound;842million South Glasgow Hospital campus will employ more than 10,000 staff and many more patients and visitors will travel to and from the building every day.But fewer than 3000 parking spaces will be provided when the 24-hour facility opens its doors next year.A council insider said: &quot;It's going to be chaos unless there is some kind of permit system. It will affect half of Govan. It'll be massive.&quot;There will be huge costs to set it up and then enforce it so it could mean residents paying up to &pound;50 a year for each space.&quot;We can't just build more car parks for staff and patients because it's supply and demand - it will only encourage more people to use cars.&quot;The Evening Times understands a controlled parking zone (CPZ) is being planned.High-level talks have taken place between council and NHS bosses in recent weeks.They hope to introduce a scheme which would see bays painted on residential streets.But the parking spaces will not be exclusive to homeowners with permits - they will also be available to motorists who put money in meters.Glasgow City Council's roads spokesman, Councillor Alistair Watson, insisted those who live in Govan would get priority.He said: &quot;On-street parking controls in the nearby neighbourhoods would dissuade all-day commuter parking during the working week and would give residents parking priority.&quot;Without the sustainable transport improvements and the on-street parking controls, indiscriminate parking and difficulties for residents to find an available parking space near their property are likely to occur.&quot;Consultation events are to be held at Elder Park library later this month for residents to have their say on designs which are said to be &quot;at a preliminary stage.&quot;Govan councillor James Adams said: &quot;I'd encourage residents to come along to the information days and help us shape the strategy for protecting their ability to park outside their homes.&quot;These measures are designed to dissuade the use of private cars, particularly, by commuters, through providing a high-quality and more sustainable mode of transport as an attractive alternative.&quot;These issues are commonplace in other areas of the city and the objective of the controls is intended to ensure that commuter parking does not become problematic for the local residents.&quot;The events at Elder Park library will be held on October 23 and 24 between 10am and 5pm and on October 25 between 10am and 3pm.The new multi-storey hospital at the current Southern General campus will have more than 1400 beds and employ upwards of 10,000 workers.Patients, facilities and staff will be transferred to the building from the Southern General, the Victoria Infirmary, the Western and Yorkhill Children's Hospital.Some services from other hospitals, including the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, will also move to Govan.There will be only 2800 parking spaces when it opens because the top tier of a car park will still be under construction. The remaining 700 bays will be available in 2016.As part of the planning process, a Transport Assessment was undertaken and measures aimed at avoiding roads chaos were identified.These include improved public transport services to and from the hospital as well as upgraded walking and cycling routes.peter.swindon@eveningtimes.co.uk###
191|||SCOTTISH Secretary Alistair Carmichael has called on Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to rule out a rapid second independence referendum, following last month's No vote. Call to Sturgeon to rule out second referendum SCOTTISH Secretary Alistair Carmichael has called on Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to rule out a rapid second independence referendum, following last month's No vote.At the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Carmichael said the issue of bringing Scots together after the poll was a &quot;big test&quot; for the SNP leadership and Ms Sturgeon in particular, as the likely successor to Alex Salmond.He told activists: &quot;We settled the independence question in a way that was legal, fair and decisive. And we won. But now the campaign is over and now we need to move the 45% who voted Yes and the 55% who voted No.&quot;People of Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom and that democratic decision must be respected.&quot;So now is the time to use your imagination, and to take action that really will deliver change for Scotland ... change that will benefit all of our United Kingdom.&quot;We can all wave flags, join protests and march if we want to. But wouldn't it be better to set those things aside, to accept the will of the Scottish people and to put your shoulder to the wheel in our common endeavour?&quot;For the SNP leadership - for Nicola Sturgeon - this is of course a big test. It is disappointing that she has declined to rule out pushing for a second referendum in less than three years from now.&quot;There is still time for her to clarify that she will push for no such thing. And I hope she will take that opportunity.&quot;Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: &quot;Britain will never be the same again but I can assure you that the Liberal Democrats will never support a nationalist effort to create an unstable form of devolution as a ticking time bomb deliberately designed to deliver independence.&quot;So there is a test for the SNP - will they be like Gollum in Lord of the Rings, torn apart by the lust for the ring of independence?&quot;Or will they work constructively with others to create Home Rule that is stable, as well as powerful, inside the United Kingdom? That is the real test.&quot;SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said: &quot;The Lib Dems made a vow to deliver extensive new powers to the people of Scotland - it is time for them to honour that.&quot;Alistair Carmichael, Willie Rennie and Danny Alexander should be focusing their efforts on ensuring their Tory chums keep their promises on powers. In the past week we have seen Tory talk of three-year delays and attempts to hold Scotland's powers to ransom over English votes for English laws.&quot;This is not good enough.&quot;###

194|||RULES covering marshalls who keep order at the hundreds of parades which take place in Glasgow each year are to be tightened up. Council tightens rules over parade marshalls RULES covering marshalls who keep order at the hundreds of parades which take place in Glasgow each year are to be tightened up.The city council recently reviewed its policy on parades and consulted a wide range of affected organisations.These included community councils, all the main parade organisations, religious groups, transport operators, shopping centres, the Chamber of Commerce and the police.As a result, a number of changes have been made to the parade policy drawn up by the council.All marches must have one steward or marshall to every 10 people taking part.The council is now demanding they must all be trained at a standard agreed by the local authority.Stewards must be briefed by the organiser and given guidance and instruction in their role. They must carry proof of status and co-operate with the police and take instructions from them.All marshalls must wear suitable clothing to make themselves easy to identify and conduct themselves in a proper manner.A report to councillors says: &quot;The policy currently requires all procession organisers must ensure a ratio of one steward to every 10 participants.&quot;This has generally been accepted and through the efforts of the principal marching organisations and Police Scotland, substantial progress has been made in raising the numbers and quality of trained stewards.&quot;This contributes to a well-run procession which allows the police to concentrate more effectively on other aspects of parade management.&quot;There is, however, room for further improvement, especially across organisations less used to parading on a regular basis.&quot;The new rules says &shy;anyone under the influence of alcohol or drugs must not be allowed to take part in a parade.But the restriction banning parade bands from playing near to places of worship has been relaxed.The previous policy restricted the playing of music before 9am and after 6pm and on passing places of worship, whether or not a service was under way in the building.Some organisers questioned the policy, saying it should be relaxed and should only apply when services were being held.The report says: &quot;They considered the current total ban on playing music on passing places of worship, including not permitting the marking of time by a drum beat, caused problems in keeping to time and formation and introduced delays to the passage of parades.&quot;Processions will continue to be told to stop playing music when approaching or passing places of worship, irrespective of whether or not a service is in progress.The 100m quiet zone on either side of the buildings will continue to be implemented.But bands leading processions will be allowed a single tap on a single snare drum.Last year, 390 organisations marched through the city compared to almost 500 in 2009.vivienne.nicoll@eveningtimes.co.uk###
195|||COVERT internet investigators have been drafted in to catch armed robbers behind a £230,000 designer watch heist. Dragnet: Special web team probes city watch heist COVERT internet investigators have been drafted in to catch armed robbers behind a £230,000 designer watch heist.High-tech crime experts are trawling the web in a bid to identify and track down the four balaclava-clad men, armed with sledgehammers and axes, who smashed into Argyll Arcade.It is thought the gang - which targeted the arcade in daylight - may try to sell their haul online.Police said it was unlikely it would be sold in the UK, as no reputable trader would touch it.Undercover officers are spending hours combing watch and jewellery dealers' websites as the hunt for the stolen items continues.Stunned shoppers watched in terror as the armed thugs staged a brazen raid on jewellery shops in Buchanan Street almost two weeks ago.A police insider said: &quot;We're very confident inroads are being made and we'll get these guys sooner rather than later. Covert investigating officers are working on the case and the inquiry team has full internet investigation support.Meanwhile, uniformed and plain-clothed police have been carrying out investigations at the Arcade and the scene where a suspected getaway car was dumped.Last week, scores of motorists and pedestrians were quizzed by detectives hunting the axe-wielding raiders,. It took just 54 seconds to smash open window display cases at Argyll Arcade and escape with the haul of top-of-the-range watches.Police also revealed the car had been stolen from outside a house in Haddington, East Lothian just hours before the raid.After dumping it, it is thought the gang headed towards Edinburgh in a Vauxhall Combo van.Detective Inspector Alasdair Barlow, leading the investigation, has urged anyone with information to contact police.

Kevin Bridges reveals he beat a gambling addiction thanks to advice from John Hartson COMEDIAN Kevin Bridges has revealed he beat a spiralling gambling addiction thanks to sage advice from former Celtic striker John Hartson.In his autobiography We Need to Talk About... Kevin Bridges, released this week, the 27-year-old millionaire stand-up comic talks details how he began betting obsessively.It was on a night out to a casino during his sell-out 2012 tour that Bridges first realised he was squandering all his hard-earned money.Talking to former gambling addict and Celtic star Hartson, however, finally convinced the comedian to face his own demons.Bridges, who grew up in Clydebank, says his betting habit started to grow after he first won acclaim on the comedy circuit in 2005.&quot;I was 18 when I discovered the bookies and then lost &pound;800 in one day,&quot; he writes. &quot;It was my first decent comedy club money and I blew it. I was gambling on coupons, machines, everything.&quot;I won a fair bit on a roulette machine and went out and bought a PlayStation.&quot;I took it back the next day because I felt like a flash b******.&quot;Like I'd turned into Kanye West or someone. Everything I made I was betting.&quot;I wasn't making that much money, thankfully, but it was becoming a bit of a problem.&quot;peter.swindon @evening times.co.uk###

Council services 'to be hit by strike' Stretched council services are set to be put under further strain if members of trade union Unison go on strike later this month.Hundreds of people who work at councils across the west of Scotland have voted to walk out in a pay dispute.The move could affect a range of council departments, including social work and land and environmental services.Unison branch secretaries were summoned to a meeting in Glasgow on Friday where the union leadership revealed that 53.5% supported industrial action.Talks between union leaders and council umbrella body Cosla broke down last year and a 1% pay increase for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 was imposed.Unite and GMB members took the deal but 65% of Unison members voted for an industrial ballot in July.The leadership has demanded an additional &pound;1 an hour for every worker, meaning those who work a 35-hour week would be in line for a &pound;1,872 per year pay increase.The union's regional officer for local government, Dougie Black, said: &quot;Unison has consulted members and has a democratic decision and a mandate to take further action. Branch secretaries could not have been clearer at our meeting on Friday. What was discussed was not whether we should take action but how.&quot;Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry, said: &quot;I wrote to Unison making a personal plea that they back away from a harmful strike which will serve no purpose and hit the pockets of their member's weeks before Christmas but it seems I have been ignored.&quot;We should be concentrating our efforts on the next round of negotiations next month, which are now threatened as a consequence of this decision.&quot;peter.swindon @eveningtimes.co.uk###

206|||New cracks have been found in one of the reactors at the Hunterston B nuclear power station in Ayrshire, the BBC has learned. Cracks found at Hunterston nuclear power station New cracks have been found in one of the reactors at the Hunterston B nuclear power station in Ayrshire, the BBC has learned.
The plant's operator, EDF Energy, has insisted the cracking was predicted to occur as the station ages.
The firm said the issue would not affect the safe operation of the reactor. 
But anti-nuclear campaigners said it highlighted a potential problem for similar reactors around the UK. 
The cracks were found during a routine inspection which began in August. 
Two of about 3,000 graphite bricks in the core of reactor four at Hunterston are affected. 
These cracks have occurred since the last inspection in 2011. 
EDF Energy said the cracking was predicted to happen as the plant gets older.
The findings have no safety implications and are well within any limits for safe operation agreed with our regulator”
Colin Weir, station director at Hunterston, said: &quot;The graphite core is made up of around 6,000 bricks. 
&quot;During the outage we found two bricks with a new crack which is what we predicted during Hunterston B's lifetime as a result of extensive research and modelling. 
&quot;It will not affect the operation of this reactor and we also expect that a few additional cracks will occur during the next period of operation.
He added: &quot;The small number of cracked bricks found during routine inspection is in line with our expectations; the findings have no safety implications and are well within any limits for safe operation agreed with our regulator.&quot;
The reactor returned to service on Sunday evening, after the energy firm received approval from the Office for Nuclear Regulation. 
Hunterston B has two advanced gas-cooled reactors, similar to those found at nuclear plants around the UK. 
Hunterston began operating in 1976 and its working life has already been extended to 2023 - well beyond its planned closure date.
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said news of the cracks at Hunterston highlighted the importance of embracing &quot;cleaner, safer forms of energy&quot;. 
He added: &quot;These cracks are a sign that we can expect these nuclear facilities to become increasingly unreliable in the future.
&quot;As Scotland continues to grow its renewables capacity we can look forward to a day when we can switch off nuclear power for good.&quot;###
207|||New cracks found in the core of the Hunterston-B nuclear reactor could threaten operator EDF's plans to extend the Scottish power station's life. New cracks in Hunterston reactor New cracks found in the core of the Hunterston-B nuclear reactor could threaten operator EDF's plans to extend the Scottish power station's life.
Experts say fissures in two of the 3,000 graphite fuel bricks that make up its No 4 core are of a new type.
These &quot;Keyway root cracks&quot; are said to be more serious than previously identified fractures.
Safety rules stipulate that if the new problem gets above a certain threshold, the reactor would have to close.
Hunterston-B came online in 1976, and was due to close in 2016, but EDF wants to keep it running until 2023 and beyond.
The cracks might put the life extension timetable in question, and could mark the beginning of the end for Hunterston-B and the older Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs), which generate around 15 % of UK electricity. 
Serious distortion of the graphite core due to cracking could prevent the insertion of control rods, which are essential for safety and are used to shut down the reactor in an emergency. 
&quot;It is believed [the cracks] may eventually affect lots and lots of bricks, and it may be the life-limiting feature of the reactors,&quot; Dr Laurence Poulter, of the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), told a group of experts meeting in Manchester recently.
He said there was no immediate impact on safety, but the new cracks were a &quot;marker.&quot;
Prof Paul Mummery, an expert in nuclear materials at Manchester University, said Keyway root cracking represented a significant new phase for the AGRs.
&quot;Until now, it had only been a theoretical possibility, and some had argued these cracks might not happen at all, but that debate is now over.&quot; 
In response to a BBC inquiry, EDF's station director at Hunterston-B, Colin Weir, said the discovery was made during a periodic shutdown, which began in August. 
&quot;We found two bricks with a new crack, which is what we predicted during Hunterston-B's lifetime as a result of extensive research and modelling,&quot; he explained. The official said it would not affect the safety of the reactor.
The ONR regulator made no reference to the new cracks when it announced (1 October) that it was permitting Reactor No 4 at Hunterston-B to return to service on 8 October, after a two-month shutdown estimated to have cost EDF &pound;60m.
The ONR said it was &quot;satisfied that the licensee's justification to start up the reactor&quot;, and that it could operate for a further three years, documents on its website stated.
The next inspection at Hunterston-B will take place in 18 months, and EDF has &quot;undertaken to review the inspection requirements&quot;, according to the regulator. 
Acknowledging the future &quot;business risk&quot; for the company in a statement the ONR said: &quot;If [EDF] find cracking that is within the safety case limit, but cannot show that it will remain within the safety case limit over the subsequent operational period - in that case, they would not be able to operate the reactor.&quot;
The tubular graphite bricks, each about a metre high, moderate nuclear reactions and are essential to safe operation. However, they cannot be replaced. 
Years of neutron irradiation have caused the graphite to shrink, but because the bombardment does not spread evenly through the brick material, the rates of recession are also irregular. This causes tension and eventually cracking.
Experts at EDF maintain that the new cracks are from an anomalous group of bricks and that the reactors are well within the safety case, which allows for the general cracking of up to 300 bricks (10%) before the limit is breached. 
The rates at Hunterston and its sister station Hinkley-B are between 1-2 %; the reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool are already up to 5%. 
&quot;It is proposed that we carry on using the AGRs as the rate of cracking increases, but there will come a point at which it is necessary to stop,&quot; Dr Poulter told fellow experts. 
But predicting exactly when that will be is not easy. 
EDF employs up to 200 people on its graphite programme dedicated to tackling the problems, and it is already investing &pound;300m per year to keep its nuclear power stations running. 
It's estimated a two-month stoppage alone costs the company about &pound;60m in lost revenue.
The AGRs generate the lion's share of Britain's nuclear electricity, and keeping them running until the planned new Hinkley C reactor in Somerset is completed in 2023, or later, is a key company objective for EDF. 
&quot;The question is whether it will be financially viable,&quot; says Prof Mummery.
&quot;The reactors are creaking and showing signs of age. They will need a lot of work and investment to keep particularly the older reactors operating beyond the end of the decade.&quot; 
But EDF were making the best efforts possible, he added.
The shrinkage issue is not the only problem Britain's AGRs.
A BBC investigation recently revealed that the graphite bricks were also losing weight due to oxidisation. 
This could impact their long-term safety, especially in the event of a possible ingress of water. 
EDF was granted permission by the regulator in the summer to relax its graphite weight-loss limit at the Dungeness reactor in Kent from 6.2% to 8% after it came close to breaching the original safety margin. 
Hinkley-B and Hunterston-B are also getting close to their higher 15% limits, too. 
The ONR said changes were safe.
In 2006, both reactors developed cracks in &quot;ageing&quot; boiler tubes&quot;, forcing the operator to reduce temperatures and make modifications to &quot;mitigate&quot; the effect of the &quot;failure&quot;, according to ONR documents. 
Reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool are currently offline after cracks were discovered in the heavy-duty &quot;spines&quot; that support the boilers positioned around the reactors, threatening their stability. 
&quot;This is a big one to sort out,&quot; one senior nuclear industry insider told the BBC on condition of anonymity. 
&quot;These are engineering challenges that must call into question how achievable the life-extension programme is.&quot;
Britain is struggling to find solutions alone. 
Early nuclear reactors around the world all used graphite, but only the British and the Soviet Union persevered with the technology. 
The USSR developed the RBMK design, which combined graphite with water as a coolant- a technology that went badly wrong at Chernobyl. 
Britain opted for carbon dioxide as its coolant, and that is now causing some of the problems. Only the UK employed this particular solution. 
As one nuclear expert put it: &quot;I wouldn't say EDF can't do it but I wouldn't underestimate the challenges.&quot;###

Police investigate a possible sighting of missing Thai woman Amunai Hobbs A woman who disappeared after missing her flight to Thailand may have been sighted walking without shoes in the street near Glasgow Airport.
Amunai Hobbs, 41, also known as Amunai Nicholson, from Oban, left the airport on Thursday saying she felt unwell. 
There have been no confirmed sightings since she left Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley without treatment at 10:35. 
However, one report has placed her about halfway between the hospital and the airport a short time later.
The witness said she may have been on Inchinnan Road, near Fleming Street, between 11:30 and 12:30 and did not appear to be wearing shoes. 
Police have renewed their appeal for sightings of Ms Hobbs, who is from Thailand but lives in Scotland. 
She is described as about 4ft 10 in tall, of slim build with short black hair. 
At the last confirmed sighting she was wearing a beige-coloured fur coat, a purple dress with staining down the front, purple leggings and brown boots.
The reported sighting on Inchinnan Road described a woman wearing a grey cardigan with large buttons on the front, black cropped leggings and she was not wearing shoes.
Insp Gary Noonan said: &quot;Searches are continuing using a number of resources including the force helicopter and specialist search officers, however we have yet to trace Amunai.
&quot;This is a very distressing time for her family and friends and they are extremely concerned for her wellbeing and safety. It is out of character for her not to keep in contact with them.
&quot;I would urge anyone with any information on her whereabouts, or has seen someone matching her description to contact Paisley Police Office on 101.&quot;###

211|||Alex Neil described Hamilton Academical's victory over Celtic as "the pinnacle" of their season so far. Hamilton: Alex Neil proud after 'magnificent' Celtic Park win  Alex Neil described Hamilton Academical's victory over Celtic as &quot;the pinnacle&quot; of their season so far. 
 Ali Crawford scored the only goal as Accies won at Celtic Park for the first time in 76 years to move top of the Scottish Premiership. 
 &quot;It really was David versus Goliath,&quot; said player-manager Neil, 33. 
 &quot;It's a magnificent achievement. Having such a young group, I was extremely proud of them. They were magnificent, right throughout the team.&quot; 
 The Lanarkshire side have dropped only seven points since winning promotion to the top flight via last season's play-offs, but Neil insists their &quot;excellent start&quot; is in-keeping with his expectations. 
 &quot;They don't surprise me, I think they surprise everybody else,&quot; he explained. 
 &quot;I've had them since they were so young. I was the 17s coach, the 20s coach and now I'm the first-team coach. 
 &quot;I've got complete faith and belief in them and I think it's the exact same with them towards me. They believe what I'm telling them is the right thing and, if they do it properly, they'll win the games. 
 &quot;It's working for us at the moment. 
 &quot;Our aim isn't to go and win the league. It's more about points for us. There are certain points tallies that you accumulate over the season and you know where that will roughly get you from years gone by. That's more what I'm looking at the moment. 
 &quot;They [our targets] will only change once we get safe.&quot; 
 Though Neil did not make an appearances from the substitutions' bench, Neil was booked for dissent in the second half. 
 &quot;It was my token booking for every football game I'm involved in,&quot; he said in jest. 
 &quot;I'm actually surprised that I wasn't booked when I was at Dundee v Aberdeen yesterday. I'm an animated figure. I want them to do so well for themselves and that's where that comes from.&quot; 
 And, of match-winning goalscorer Crawford, Neil said: &quot;He's a terrific little talent. 
 &quot;If you give Ali Crawford time and space to play, he's got real, real quality. He can hit off both feet, he's got a great range of passing and I think his work-rate and desire has improved considerably in the last season.&quot; 
 Accies' emphasis on passing and possession is similar to the style Celtic boss Ronny Deila has been seeking to implement at the Scottish champions. 
 And, although the Norwegian finds his team trailing the new league leaders by six points, Neil urged onlookers to judge Deila &quot;in the second half of the season&quot;. ###

But even though the local fishermen had promised his gloves would shield him, the massive, writhing electric eel had other ideas.
It leapt out of his grasp and zapped Jock with 60 volts, leaving him temporarily paralysed.
But the Scottish chef and adventurer says the&nbsp;experience was well worth it because his customers had never tasted an entree like it.
The 38-year-old restaurateur’s Amazon trip was one in a series of journeys braving extreme cuisine all over the world for new TV programme Nomad Chef, produced by the Discovery Channel. In the series he gets tips for the pot from tribal cooks in places like Vanuatu in the South Pacific, visits remote corners of Japan and joins isolated communities in Africa and Peru.
Born in Glasgow, Jock grew up in Ayr and landed his first job in the kitchens at Turnberry before working with top chefs in London to earn his spurs.
When he was 18, he spent a year working in Australia and fell in love with the country.
He later returned and established himself as one of the foremost chefs Down Under, starring in MasterChef Australia and opening an acclaimed restaurant in Adelaide focusing on native Australian ingredients.
Jock, who has two daughters Sofia, eight, and Ava, 13, would spend months in the Outback, camping with Aboriginal tribes to learn their culinary ways. He used that experience to create his restaurant Orana and gastro pub Street ADL.

Those skills brought him to the attention of the Discovery Channel documentary team who knew he was the right man to take on their missions.
And although he was reluctant to devote too much time to TV, Jock said he loved the idea because it fitted in with his own cooking philosophies.
“I first went to Australia because I wanted to try something different.
“There were huge fusion menus with Japanese, Thai and lots of Asian foods and that was very inspiring.
“But I started to wonder what Australian cuisine was. So I started digging and that brought me out on this path.
“I realised I couldn’t make anything unless I understood the people, the culture, the ingredients, the dreaming and the stories that went with it.
“That is when I went out to the bush to just observe and learn about people and their history.
“Us Scots have been through several toils and troubles ourselves and I don’t carry the baggage of first settlers, I’m coming at it as a passionate Scotsman who wants to learn from them.”
Braving the notoriously hostile Australian wilderness, he picked up ingredients, techniques and styles that he later developed into his popular restaurant Orana, serving up dishes such as fermented grey mangrove seeds and marron lobster tails.
His efforts had not gone unnoticed. While he had never wanted to go down the TV chef route, preferring to stick with his mission to celebrate native ingredients, he did appear on MasterChef Australia.
And he was the man the Discovery team had in mind to front their new series that combined adventure travelogue and cookery, Nomad Chef.
Jock explained: “We go out and learn from a community and bring things back to the restaurant to see what we can do with them. It’s gone down really well.”
The first port of call was the tiny island of Vanuatu, where the women are topless and the only clothing men wear is a horn sheath.
They cook food using volcanic rocks and unearthed amazing fish and local produce. Jock said he was an awed spectator.
“None of it was set up, it was very documentary-style. You’re thrown into the deep end and you just have to deal with it. We maintain a huge amount of&nbsp;integrity – it’s not like dressing someone up like some bull TV programme where they make the host wear something daft to patronise these people.
“We go in there and we don’t patronise them or make fun of them, we just get on with it.”
His journeys also took Jock to extremes in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.
“I loved the Faroe Islands, that was incredible. It was like Scotland and they made me feel at home.
“The landscape was phenomenal and the produce is incredible, like their wonderful langoustines and cod.
“The Peruvian Amazon was amazing. We cooked alligator and I got stung by an electric eel.
“It’s got 60 volts – that can kill you. They gave me rubber gloves and said I’d be fine, so we set the bait and caught it.
“It was massive and really thick, so I’m picking it up by the gullet and it just zapped me. My arm was numb for&nbsp;hours.
“Everywhere we went was dangerous to some degree. We were in Ethiopia for Christmas and they all chip in to buy a cow and stand around eating it raw. The whole thing. The stomach, the gullet, the hump off its back – the lot.
“It’s their Christmas day so you can’t be rude. I got really sick after that. But anything I am given I will eat.”
With the new series launching around the world next week, Jock knows his profile is about to jump.
No lover of TV fame, he jokes about having his face pixelated for the series but admits he has found the perfect series for his approach to cookery.
“We’re talking about season two if it goes well and if we make sure that we continue with the integrity and the locations are right and it’s something people are interested in.
“I’d no idea I would end up here. Even if you asked me 15 years ago when I first moved to Australia, I’d never have thought I’d follow the path to all of these places around the world and a television show like this.
“But there’s never a dull moment, it’s been some journey.”

213|||A brave mum who has a rare cancer that affects just one in a million people has spoken for the first time about her fight against the life-threatening disease. Mum tells how an eye test saved her life - Daily Record When doctors told Julie Morton she had eye cancer, her first reaction was to burst out laughing.
The 33-year-old mum had been having problems with her vision but had no idea the diagnosis would be so drastic.
And who could blame her? After all, how many people know that eye cancer even exists?
Now, as she continues her own fight, brave Julie is keen to raise awareness of the disease, in the hope that deaths can be avoided.
Julie first suspected there was something wrong when her vision went cloudy during a day out with her one-year-old son Daniel and husband Paul, 40, this summer.
She shrugged it off as tiredness and put a note in her diary to make an appointment to have her sight tested.
Julie told the Paisley Daily Express: “It was a nice July day and I noticed I was having trouble making out faces.
“I’m supposed to wear glasses but I never do and I thought maybe it was time for a new prescription.”
Julie and Daniel visited the optician just minutes away from her home in Greenhill Crescent, Linwood, and she was put through the usual tests – letter charts and following a pen as it was moved inches from her face.
However, the results were quite different to what she had expected.
Julie explained: “I was told to phone Paul right away and have him take Daniel.
“The lady wrote me a letter and told me to head straight to accident and emergency.
“She said I had a lump behind my right eye.”
Julie made a beeline for the Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley, where she was rushed straight through for a detailed examination.
She was told there was an “abnormality” but would need to wait a month for a second opinion from specialists at Glasgow’s Gartnavel Hospital.
In the meantime, she had to try to get through a week-long holiday in York.
Julie said: “We were down there to visit relatives but it was very difficult to relax.
“My family kept on telling me it would be fine but, deep down, I was worried.”
After returning home, Julie was asked to see her doctor, who had some devastating news.
“I was told I had eye cancer but I just burst out laughing,” she recalled. “It was just so hard to take in.”
Julie was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma – a one-in-a-million condition that, usually, only affects pensioners.
She was referred for radiotherapy, which involved surgeons inserting a piece of metal – the size of a 20p coin – behind her eye, along with small pellets of medicine in a bid to prevent the cancer from spreading around her body.
Now all she can do is wait and hope the tumour shrinks.
Julie, who uses humour to take everything in her stride, said: “My vision is already 80 per cent gone in my right eye and I’ve been told it’s likely I’ll go fully blind in it.
“It’s really tough but I’m not giving up.
“My worst fear is leaving my husband widowed and my wee boy without a mum.
“My family give me something to fight for and I’m not going to let this beat me.
“Thankfully, the treatment won’t lead to any hair-loss but I’m a bit gutted I won’t lose any weight on it!”
● Julie is urging all Express readers to make sure they have their eyes checked on a regular basis. You can go online to find details of your nearest optician.###
214|||AFTER more than four years as a willing accomplice in a relentless attack on the poor, the Deputy Prime Minister finally claims to have found a backbone. Record View: Nick Clegg pledging too little too late - Record View - Daily Record NICK Clegg has some cheek.
After more than four years as a willing accomplice in a relentless attack on the poor, the Deputy Prime Minister finally claims to have found a backbone.
The Lib Dem leader yesterday vowed not to join another coalition with the Tories if they planned to cut public spending further.
Instead he says his party would raise taxes on the well off to keep the national debt under control. Well, bully for him.
Does Clegg really think this shameless &shy;electioneering is going to be enough to make people forget the bedroom tax?
Scandalous fit for work tests? The surging need for food banks in one of the world’s richest countries? His party’s broken promise on tuition fees to students down south?
If he does think that, he is in for a rude awakening.
Clegg and his Lib Dem cronies are in Glasgow for their last party conference before the General Election next May.
Since signing up with the Tories in 2010, the party have already been crushed in the council and Scottish Parliament elections.
The upcoming Westminster election will complete their destruction at the hands of the electorate.
Even high-profile MPs in safe seats like Scot Danny Alexander are not safe.
Yesterday in his speech to conference, &shy;Alexander said the Lib Dems would use a “fairness rule” so that the wealthiest in society contribute the biggest share of their income towards deficit reduction.
Well the people of Scotland and Britain have a “fairness rule” too, Danny.
And it is about to see your party consigned to the dustbin of history.
To have a son murdered in barbaric circumstances is every mum’s worst nightmare.
It is impossible to imagine what it must feel like to find out your other son was responsible.
But that is the horrifying situation April Moore found herself in after a tragic fight between her two boys after the family had celebrated Christmas and New Year together.
In an act of drink-fuelled madness, Peter stabbed his brother Derek four times and inflicted 75 separate injuries on him.
Now one son is dead and the other will rightly spend a long time behind bars.
And April is left to pick up the pieces.
The Great Scottish Run is now firmly established as one of the highlights of the year.
Several famous names were among the thousands of runners who took part in the 10k and half-marathon races yesterday.
Some did it for fun, others to raise money for charity or for a personal fitness goal.
What a superb advert for Glasgow and all of Scotland.
Congratulations to all who took part.###

The Glasgow based company enjoyed a jump in profits from &pound;2.5m to &pound;3.3m on the back of a 1.9 per cent increase in turnover to &pound;32.7m despite challenging market conditions, which have been affected by volatile raw coffee prices and currency exchange rates.
It attributed its success to innovation after broadening its product range and launching a number of new coffees, including a premium hand-roasted microlot range.
The company also made significant strides in developing its green coffee supply chain and supporting community-based coffee-growing projects.
&nbsp;It secured substantial financial backing through the Fair Development Fund (FDF) - a unique fund&nbsp;run by&nbsp;Comic Relief and Sainsbury's - to sustainably grow the Ugandan coffee industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Gumutindo Sustainability Project&nbsp;is a collaborative project that aims to improve coffee quality and farming practices for the benefit of local communities.&nbsp; Not only will this initiative support climate adaptation, but it will increase capacity and improve coffee quality - enabling more coffee to be sold at better prices.
&nbsp;Matthew Algie chairman, Eric Hagman, said: “The Matthew Algie team delivered another outstanding performance across 2013.&nbsp; Despite continuing to face the twin challenges of an extremely competitive marketplace and uncertainties in the global coffee trade, the company was able to demonstrate its commitment to upholding ethical values and meet its obligation to exceeding the expectations of our dedicated customer base.
&nbsp;“We will of course have to work extremely hard to maintain our position as the UK and Ireland’s leading independent coffee roaster, but we are confident that our investment in innovative new products and not only retaining but continuing to develop our highly skilled staff members will allow us to aim high in the years ahead.
&nbsp;“It is a challenge we are all passionate about, and I am very proud of everyone at Matthew Algie who has contributed to ensuring that our coffee, which is sold in coffee shops, restaurants and luxury hotels all over the country, continues to be sourced in a sustainable way and tastes great at the same time.”###

Bowel cancer screening appeal made Scots aged between 50 and 74 are being urged to take part in a national bowel cancer screening programme.The Scottish Government wants as many people as possible to participate in the scheme as the cancer can often be cured if detected early using home screening kits.A public awareness campaign last year led to a rise in the number of calls to the national bowel screening centre and figures show that uptake of the programme has increased from 54% to 56% in two years.Currently 57% of bowel cancers are detected at the earliest stages and the new campaign hopes to increase that figure.Health Secretary Alex Neil said: &quot;We know that nine out of 10 people will survive bowel cancer if it is detected early.&quot;Completing and returning the home test is the simplest way to get checked - giving yourself the best possible chance of survival.&quot;However, only just over half of those eligible have taken the opportunity to get tested.&quot;Bowel cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, especially when it's caught early, and taking the test helps us to do exactly that.&quot;We want to encourage even more people to take up the services on offer and help further increase the rate of bowel cancers detected at the earliest stage, when people are least likely to need invasive treatment and most likely to survive.&quot;Sheena Edgar, 70, from Lanarkshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer after completing a routine bowel screening test three years ago.She said: &quot;I had no symptoms at all but I sent away my test anyway.&quot;Just a few days later I had a letter asking me to get in touch with the hospital to arrange a colonoscopy. They told me they found three polyps which were then sent away for testing.&quot;I then had an operation but was home three days later and felt like I was back to normal. It was all really quick.&quot;I'm very grateful for the screening service. Don't be put off doing the test - it's so simple and could save your life.&quot;Terence O'Kelly, senior medical officer and consultant colorectal surgeon, said: &quot;I know of many patients who have completed the home screening test, had a positive result, and have gone on to have polyps removed before they develop any further. These individuals have then enjoyed completely normal lives.&quot;Clearly not everyone has the same journey or outcome. However, what is clear, is that if detected early, bowel cancer is a form of disease that can be cured.&quot;For more information contact the Scottish Bowel Screening Helpline on 0800 0121 833 or visit www.bowelscreeningtest.org.###

EDF Energy said that two cracked bricks were found during a planned maintenance inspection of 6,000 that make up the reactor’s graphite core.
The operator said that the cracks were predicted and did not pose any safety risks.
Colin Weir, station director at Hunterston B, said: “Every time we take the reactor out of service for planned maintenance we inspect the graphite core which is made up of around 6,000 bricks.
“During the current Hunterston outage we found two bricks with a new crack which is what we predicted during Hunterston B’s lifetime as a result of extensive research and modelling.
“It will not affect the operation of this reactor and we also expect that a few additional cracks will occur during the next period of operation.
“The small number of cracked bricks found during routine inspection is in line with our expectations, the findings have no safety implications and are well within any limits for safe operation agreed with our regulator.”
The nuclear power station began operating in 1976 and was originally scheduled to be shut-down in 2011 but this was extended to 2016.

Officers from the Care Inspectorate and Healthcare Improvement Scotland will examine care for older people in Glasgow in a joint inspection to assess how well social and healthcare services are working together to support the elderly.
They will interview local authority and health board chiefs, and speak to older people and their support workers to ensure no-one is at risk of “falling between the gap”.
Care Inspectorate depute chief executive Karen Anderson said: “The number of older people is growing fast and everyone deserves safe, high-quality, compassionate care.
“Our inspectors will make sure we look at how well health, social work and other agencies are all working together to deliver good outcomes for older people in local communities.
“Inspectors will look at records, speak to older people, visit services and interview staff.
“We know that most care services in the city perform well and now we want to test how well they are all working together with the health service.
“No-one should fall between the gap and these new inspections are important in making sure that doesn’t happen.”
Robbie Pearson, director of scrutiny and assurance at Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: “Increasingly, individuals expect care to be integrated, flexible and responsive to their needs.
“The further integration of health and social care offers an opportunity to make care more sensitive to the needs of individuals and their families.
“As individuals move between care providers and care settings, we also need to ensure we have a more joined-up approach to scrutiny between Healthcare Improvement Scotland and the Care Inspectorate, and we will ensure that this scrutiny work is sensitive to the pathways of care that people follow.

Camping restrictions in and around one of Scotland’s premier tourist destinations are to be significantly expanded in an attempt to curb anti-social behaviour. 
New byelaws planned by the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority (LLTNPA) would curb unauthorised camping across vast swathes of the iconic loch’s shorelines as well as those surrounding Loch Earn, Loch Long and Loch Vennachar. 
The authority, responsible for the management of Scotland’s first national park, points to a growing body of evidence that that natural beauty of the area is being damaged by overuse and irresponsible visitors, who intimidate locals, leave behind litter and human waste, and even chop down trees for firewood.
It describes the new measures as “unashamedly ambitious” and claims they will help transform “problem areas” where visitor areas are in a “very poor and deteriorating state” into “world class destinations.”
The LLTNPA today approved a 12 week public consultation on the extended byelaws, part of a package which also calls for expanded formal campsites and motorhome bays across its 720 square miles remit.
The existing byelaws heralded an 81% reduction in anti-social behaviour between 2009 and 2012, according to police. There has been only one report submitted to the prosecutor fiscal in that period, the outcome of which is, as yet, unknown, although officials believe the laws act as a powerful deterrent.
Some have expressed frustration at how anti-social behaviour has migrated around the wider park area since the 2011 byelaws covering the loch’s eastern shores came into effect.
Increasing their influence, according to Fiona Logan, the LLTNPA’s chief executive, will have widespread benefits for visitors, local communities and the economy, 
“The national park is within an hour’s drive of more than 50% of Scotland’s population and this gives us specific problems which - despite our best efforts - have been escalating.
“The package of measures we are proposing has been developed in conjunction with partners and local communities and reflects our wholesale commitment to dramatically improving the experience of the park for both residents and visitors. 
“Our proposals include significant investment in camping facilities and new byelaws to support more sustainable amounts of camping and to tackle the damage caused by antisocial camping.”
Under the plans, two new management zones governed by the byelaws would be put in place - the first covering the west of Loch Lomond and the second the wider Trossachs area. The existing zone to the east of Loch Lomond was also be enlarged. 
The LLTNPA says the proposed zones would cover an area of 69.2 square kilometres - the equivalent of 3.75% of the total park area - and ensure only a “minimal impact” on those wishing to wild camp responsibly away from busy roadside locations.
The move has been welcomed by Police Scotland and residents on the east shore of the famous loch.
Kevin Lilburn, a Rowardennan resident and chair of the East Loch Lomond Visitor Management Group, said: “Previously we suffered some sort of incident at my home pretty much every weekend in the summer, including litter theft, vandalism and verbal or even physical intimidation. Since the byelaws have been introduced, there have been none. Not one. 
“That speaks for itself and official statistics tell a similar story. We have gone from a situation where my neighbours and I dreaded sunny days to one in which we can relax, enjoy where we live, and happily share the area with responsibly behaved visitors.” 
Chief superintendent Davie Flynn, divisional commander for Police Scotland.said: “We have enjoyed a longstanding positive relationship with LLTNPA and together with other partners continually strive to ensure the visitor experience is as good as it can be and that local communities are free from antisocial behaviour.
“Police Scotland welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the consultation process around the park authority’s proposals.”

229|||GEORGE Ferrier, who was signed off work by his doctor with trauma and severe bruising after the raid, said security firm GBM have refused to cover his wages while he recovers from ordeal. Hero security guard battered by masked robbers during raid on Glasgow jewellery arcade has pay docked - Daily Record TOP-HAT hero George Ferrier has had his pay docked after being crocked by the Argyll Arcade jewel robbers.
Security guard George was signed off work for a fortnight by his doctor with trauma and severe bruising after he was battered with a baseball bat during the raid .
But last night, he said security firm GBM have refused to cover his wages while he recovers from the ordeal.
The Record revealed on Saturday that popular George, 56, was the formally-attired security guard who risked his life to ensure the safety of workers in the exclusive mall off Buchanan Street in Glasgow city centre.
He said: “I have had lots of lovely messages from people in the arcade and customers inquiring on how I was doing.
“But if I’m being honest, I’m really disappointed at the way my employers have reacted. It was obvious to me that their main concern was filling my shift rather than my health and well-being.
“When I sent in the line from the GP, they didn’t say anything. But when I asked if I would be paid normal pay for the fortnight, they said I wouldn’t – that it would be statutory sick pay.”

George, a grandad, has bruises from the back of his right knee to his heels after the brutal baseball bat attack.
He got to his feet after the assault on September 14 and tried to chase the armed raiders but was finally deterred when men ran at him with axes.
Video of the incident showed him shepherding staff into shops and telling them to lock themselves in.
He refused to flee or cower after he was attacked, instead standing in the mall to face the gang as they escaped.
George, of Springburn, Glasgow, was prescribed sleeping tablets after the robbery. His partner, Annette Bradshaw, 53, made him see his GP after he went nights without sleeping and showed signs of irritability – which she guessed was post-traumatic stress.

George said: “The robbery happened on the Wednesday and I was in no state to go back in on Thursday and Friday. I wasn’t right when I got home but I couldn’t get a doctor’s appointment until the Tuesday.
“The doctor signed me off for a fortnight and gave me sleeping pills. I’m told I have to rest.”
When George checked with his office, they said he would only receive statutory sick pay , which is just &pound;87.55 a week and kicks in after an employee has been off work for four consecutive days.
George said: “I had a guy who works upstairs drop off a bottle of whisky and an old lady dropped in with a fiver and said I had to get myself a drink, which was really touching.
“I’ve had a lot of really nice feedback but the work has been keen to get me back as soon as possible.
“If they think I should be getting just sick pay after what’s happened, that’s up to them – but it doesn’t seem right to me. I’m disappointed in them.”

The daylight robbery targeted elite jewellers on Scotland’s busiest shopping street . The armed gang, who are still at large, escaped through smoke set off as part of a security system.
They sped off in a white VW Golf then a Vauxhall van on the M8.
George’s employers, GBM Security, did not return the Record’s calls.###
230|||Ayrshire entrepreneur Tom Hunter gives advice to Ayrshire school kids Sir Tom inspires future business leaders - Daily Record “Never take no for an answer - and believe in yourself.”
Those were two pieces of advice from philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter for a group of budding entrepreneurs from secondary schools across East Ayrshire at the Entrepreneurial Spark and East Ayrshire Academies Showcase at the West Coast Hatchery, in Dundonald last week.
Opening the event, Sir Tom highlighted the important role business plays in everyday life. He told the pupils: “Small businesses are the future of our economy and you are the entrepreneurs of the future.
“By participating in this schools’ business challenge you have demonstrated that you have the talent, the self belief and the right attitude to succeed. Schools in East Ayrshire are ahead of the game in terms of encouraging and nurturing young entrepreneurs with fantastic business ideas.”
The event gave the pupils a unique opportunity to learn from Sir Tom’s own experiences and to hear from some of the fledgling businesses currently in residence at the Hatchery, and follows the recent Sir Tom Hunter Challenge in June when Doon Academy scooped first prize with their Monsieur Soleil language board game.
Guest speaker was Josh Littlejohn, founder of the Social Bite caf&eacute; in Edinburgh, who impressed the young folk with his story; aged just 28, he established a sandwich business with four different outlets in Edinburgh and Glasgow, donating all profits to supporting the homeless and other good causes in Scotland, Bangladesh and Malawi.
Three successful Espark ‘chiclets’ shared details of their own entrepreneurial journeys with the youngsters; Alexa Scott, from online wedding deals company I DoLicious, Lloyd Allum, from NuWave Engineering and Lorraine McRoberts from children’s fashion business Bairnz Boutique.
Then it was the turn of the teams from three East Ayrshire schools, Auchinleck Academy, James Hamilton Academy and Doon Academy, to pitch their ideas to Sir Tom Hunter and assembled guests, including Marie Macklin from the Klin Group, Heather Dunk from Ayr College and Willie Mackie from the local chamber of commerce.
E-Spark chief executive Jim Duffy provided feedback on all the pupils’ presentations, praising them for their creativity and confidence.
Fiona Lees, chief executive of East Ayrshire Council, said: “It is inspiring to see how the young people have developed their ideas since the Challenge event in June
“Sir Tom has generously offered the services of his team at the Hatchery to help the school companies protect and develop their ideas, which have all the hallmarks of success.”###
231|||YOUNG Scots are being given a once-in-a-lifetime chance to realise their musical dreams. Here, four from inner city Glasgow tell us how it's turned their lives around. Urban legends: Music project helps young Scots fulfil their dreams in the showbiz industry - Daily Record SCOTS youngsters are hitting the high notes, thanks to a new scheme to get them playing musical instruments.
The Big Music Project aims to help young people across the UK find work and training opportunities in the music industry.
And young Scots are already reaping the benefits of the project, which is financed by the Big Lottery Fund and jointly led by Capital FM and the BPI, representing the UK’s recorded music industry.
The project has been running since March and has seen live events in Scotland featuring acts including rapper Plan B, Scots singer KT Tunstall and performers from The BRIT School.
In Glasgow, the YMCA at Tollcross has benefited from Big Music Project funds delivered through Youth Scotland. The YMCA’s community manager Darran Gillan, 38, said it had allowed the organisation to help local inner-city youngsters follow their dreams.
“In the east end of Glasgow – where there is high deprivation and kids are often brought up by their grandparents – money is scarce and spending it on&nbsp;musical instruments, never mind expanding or exploring musical culture, is not a priority,” explained Darran.
“But regardless of class or education, we all listen to music and this project is bringing people together and giving them opportunities to meet people who can help them to realise their dreams.”
Here, four of them tell us how much that means…
 

 It's a great experience to teach other people 
TEENAGER Jack Torrance was inspired to give something back after the YMCA helped him follow his DJing dream.
He decided to start up a recording studio through The Big Music Project to help others who are keen to learn.
Tollcross lad Jack, 16, said: “When I was in first year I went to a music sound lab and they taught us how to DJ and for two years I played some gigs.
“I enjoyed it and wanted to keep it going but the tutor left so DJing stopped.”
Jack, who felt DJing was better than just hanging about street corners looking for places to play football with his pals, said: “I was quite gutted when the course ended and spoke to Darran at the YMCA, who suggested we get our&nbsp;own recording studio, which we did for a number of weeks by hooking up with the Think Big project who gave us &pound;300. For stage two to happen, we went to Southampton to work on a three-day residential course.
“It was a brilliant experience. We got a &pound;2500 grant to allow us to work out what we needed to buy, so we set up a studio with a 32-track recording desk.
“We’ve now created Tollcross Recordings and have recorded hundred of songs, including one for the Commonwealth Games and an anti-sectarian song.
“Now I can train kids my own age to do what I did. It’s a great experience to be able to teach.”
 

 I was heading for the dole now I'm on the radio 
UNEMPLOYMENT was a very real prospect for Govan lad Holden Hunter after leaving high school.
Many of his friends were already on the dole after leaving education and failing to secure a job.
Instead, Holden is getting to do something he loves – and managing to make money in the process.
The 18-year-old got a job as a broadcast assistant at community radio station Sunny G for eight months and the station were so pleased with his contribution that they kept him on.
The icing on the cake came when Holden attended a Big Music Project Hub at the Tollcross YMCA, who soon introduced him to movers and shakers in the music business.
Holden said: “I come from a working-class background and was always brought up to get the job done but I really wanted to enjoy what I worked at.
“I’ve not looked back. It’s been amazing getting to know the people and I’ve now secured my own Saturday show on Sunny G.
“The Big Music Project Hub acts as a network for me to meet aspiring Scots artists and, as well as giving them exposure, it gives me content for my show.
“Some of my friends struggle to get into the industry and this is helping them, too.”
Holden added: “The Big Music Project has offered a lot more new opportunities for me and has helped me to mature and leave some bad things behind.”
 

 I'm not as shy as I used to be 
SHY Nicole McCurry has come out of her shell after getting together with The Big Music Project through Tollcross YMCA.
The 17-year-old has gone from singing in her bedroom to performing live at the Commonwealth Games.
Nicole began volunteering at the centre, joined the committee and started running her own dance classes.
It wasn’t long before someone at the centre heard her singing and asked her to get more involved.
Nicole said: “I used to sing in my bedroom and, if I felt brave, I’d post videos of myself on Facebook.
“At the centre, Keith from East End Beats asked me to sing, then told me they wanted me to do the vocals on the anti-sectarianism song and then on the Commonwealth Games track, Shine, they were doing.
“I wasn’t always confident, I was quite shy. The only people I would really sing to were my sister and my closest friend.
“The YMCA and The Big Music Project got me to sing live on stage and showed me how to be more confident.
“Through the Commonwealth Games track, I also met people from places like Ghana and learned so much.
“I got a job I wanted rather than doing stuff just to get by.
“I’ve been on the telly, done interviews and even sang on stage with people from the Brit&nbsp;Awards.”
 Rapping built up my confidence to write lyrics 
ARRIVING in Glasgow from a troubled home with no running water, electricity or security in Tanzania made Godfrey Shane, 11, an angry and frightened boy.
But rather than staying resentful about his childhood experiences, he decided to start writing music and rap about his life.
It has become a roadway to a career that has allowed Godfrey, now 25, to share his stories and encourage other vulnerable young people to express themselves through rap. His project Urban Sound Scotland, a joint venture with his friend John Thompson, 25, of Nigerian and German origin, has just received funding to go into schools and educate children about music and culture as part of the Commonwealth Games legacy in Glasgow.
Godfrey said: “My parents were arguing and I thought I had caused certain situations to happen. I was a playful kid but when I got back to my house I would be down.”
He initially rapped along to 50 Cent songs but soon realised he could have more impact by writing his own lyrics.
He said: “It built my confidence to write my own poems. I now tell others to write down something that lies deep within them and come up with a riff.”
Godfrey and John are keen to help other kids from ethnic minorities who live in Glasgow to realise their potential and they want to educate others in the east end about different cultures.
“We haven’t started going into schools yet but we want people to know how accessible everything is here compared to elsewhere.
“People in Africa don’t have water and electricity and don’t have money to feed their families.
“We want to share knowledge through rap and education.”###

Drumchapel thug now the most wanted man in Britain KNIFE thug Jonathan Kelly is the top target on a list of most-wanted criminals in the UK.The 34-year-old has been on the run in Glasgow for a month since he breached his licence conditions on release from prison.Police have so far failed to find him.Today the Evening Times can reveal he has been named on Crime-stoppers' hit list of dangerous criminals on the run.Kelly, of Drumchapel, went into hiding weeks after he was acquitted of historic rape and abduction charges.A team of dedicated officers is working around the clock to &quot;flush him out&quot;.Kelly, locked up for crimes of violence, had been freed from Low Moss Prison, Bishop-briggs, but failed to report to police.One senior police source believes Kelly has been supported by friends - or former inmates from his long spell in prison.He said: &quot;We are trawling CCTV and the internet for information which will lead us to Kelly. We are also widening the net, not just speaking to the same four or five associates. We are looking at people he may have come into contact with in prison.&quot;It might take some time, but we will flush him out.&quot;Officers also believe Kelly's digital footprint - including any possible social media profiles - could be key to hunting him down.Last month, we told that he was acquitted of nine charges at the High Court in Glasgow on August 21.Not proven verdicts were returned on four charges - including sexual assault - and not guilty on the remaining five charges, including abduction. The three sexual assaults, one indecent assault and abduction, were alleged to have taken place between 1998 and 2002.People have been warned not to approach Kelly and to call 999 if they spot him.rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

Teenage girl threw flare at cup game A TEENAGE girl who told police that Rangers Football Club were "her life" has been found guilty of throwing a flare on to a football pitch.Emma Leslie, 17, wept in the dock at Falkirk Sheriff Court as she was found guilty of two charges during a Scottish cup tie.The match, a fourth round tie between Rangers and Falkirk, was played at Falkirk's Westfield Stadium.The teenager, studying child care at college, has been banned from all Rangers matches since the incident last November.Leslie, of Edinburgh Road, Glasgow, was found guilty of possessing a controlled substance, namely a flare, in a sports ground.She was also convicted of culpably and recklessly lighting a flare and throwing it on to the playing surface, while acting with another person.She had denied the charges.Police Officer Allana Lees told the court that CCTV footage showed Leslie with a man at the game.

238|||SERIOUS incidents in schools in Glasgow's South Side have soared in just one year. Serious 'incidents' rise across Glasgow schools SERIOUS incidents in schools in Glasgow's South Side have soared in just one year.New figures from Glasgow City Council show serious incidents - events that could lead to a child being permanently excluded - in the south of the city have risen by 77%.Across the city, numbers are up are up nearly 20%.&quot;Serious incidents&quot; can include drug dealing, carrying a weapon to school or assaulting a teacher or pupil.The most serious sanction a school has is to remove or exclude a child permanently.The number of serious incidents in schools have been reducing since 2011 but are up this year in the North West and South of the city.For the years 2012/13, there were 66 serious incidents in the North East of Glasgow, dropping to 55 for 2013/14.But the number for the North West has spiked over the same period from 39 to 48.And in the South of the city the number has rocketed from 36 to 64 - up 77%.However, figures also show attendances at primary, secondary and Additional Support for Learning (ASL) schools is up across the board.The Scottish Government stopped publishing attendance data some years ago and so there is no nationwide comparison.But in Glasgow the number of days lost to pupil absence is on the decline.Councillor Stephen Curran, Executive Member for Education and Young People, said: &quot;With increased attendance, reductions in exclusions and attainment across the board at an all time high, Glasgow is constantly driving up standards in education and our young people are really starting to reap the benefits. If our children are not in school then they are not learning.&quot;Parents can be assured of our commitment to build on this success story and continue to raise standards across the city.&quot;Attendance in ASL schools is the lowest in the city, at 90.1%, compared to 91.5% for secondaries and 94.1% for primaries.Education bosses say children with additional needs tend to have lower attendance rates due to illness.Totals are also affected by the number of children who have left mainstream education and are being taught in specialist provision.Exclusions are decreasing, with a 15% reduction in exclusion incidents across all three sectors from last year.Since 2006/2007, when exclusions were at their highest levels, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of pupils banned from schools.The report shows the greatest success at reducing exclusions is at secondary level.Teachers use positive behaviour approaches, such as restorative justice techniques, and look at what is causing a pupil's poor behaviour.Broken down month by month, the figures show that exclusions are more likely in November and March.A small number of pupils are being excluded from school more than once.Two thirds of excluded primary and secondary pupils are taken out of school once, but others have found themselves excluded repeatedly- some more than seven times.Education bosses said although it is positive that exclusions are falling, too many pupils are still being repeatedly excluded.On average, secondary pupils are excluded for 2.2 days per incident, although this varies between schools, with one excluding pupils for six days on average.The report states exclusion should only be used when there are no other options, as it can be hard for children to reintegrate .catriona.stewart@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
239|||PLANS to build a new bridge over the Clyde received a vote of approval from local residents. Residents back £50m bid for new bridge on the Clyde PLANS to build a new bridge over the Clyde received a vote of approval from local residents.But the &pound;50million price tag raised the question of why it was so high.Last week The Evening Times reported the new road bridge would link Yoker, in the west of Glasgow, to Renfrew.Work on the project, which is being led by Renfrewshire Council, is likely to begin in 2018 or 2019.The bridge will be able to open to let vessels pass up and down the river.Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said it would be a &quot;spectacular sight&quot; when it is built.Retired Yoker resident, Sandra Aitken, 62, backed the plans.She said: &quot;For the people that live here, and the people in Knightswood, I think it's fantastic.&quot;It would take you to Braehead, instead of going away along through the Clyde Tunnel, so it'll be marvellous.&quot;Ms Aitken said she favoured a bridge over the existing Renfrew ferry, which runs every 30 minutes, connecting Yoker to Renfrew.She said: &quot;We've not got the big ferry now, it's that wee tiny one and I wouldn't go on it, I'm too frightened.&quot;Not everyone was overjoyed. Commuter Stuart Mitchell commented on The Evening Times Website: &quot;The roads through Renfrew town centre cannot cope with the current traffic.&quot;Adding more, via any new bridge, will just cause more tailbacks.&quot;It can take me 20 minutes to go a mile some evenings.&quot;One Yoker resident, who lives near the ferry quay, thought the bridge would help traffic in the area.Susan Edmiston, 66, said: &quot;I should imagine it could help the traffic. A lot of people park on this street and go across on the ferry. If it means they can get their car across on the bridge it'll lessen traffic on this street and could be all well and good.&quot;However, she was unsure about the planned cost.She said: &quot;&pound;50m is an awful lot of money just to build a bridge. I'm not sure exactly where they get their figures from.&quot;Local takeaway owners Catherine and James Richards, 53 and 58, from Yoker, both hope the bridge will improve business in the area during and after construction.James said: &quot;Over the years, the ferry has changed hands that many times, you don't even know who's going to be running the ferry.&quot;Now it's a wee tin thing.&quot;There's going to be a lot of workmen about when they build it and I've got a wee takeaway here so it's going to help my business, I hope.&quot;Catherine said: &quot;I suppose &pound;50m is a bit dear but it's still a good thing, it'll help traffic around here.&quot;It'll also improve businesses here because, when the ferry breaks down, nobody can get over to Yoker.&quot;The bridge is part of the &pound;1.13billion City Deal for the Glasgow region.The deal will sees the UK and Scottish Governments each give &pound;500m of extra investment to the city, which local councils will supplement by borrowing a further &pound;130m.This money will be used to pay for infrastructure projects which could boost the area's economy by &pound;2.4bn annually.Mr Macmillan said: &quot;Renfrewshire is at the forefront of the City Deal programme, with projects to develop the long-awaited rail link to Glasgow Airport and further development at Clyde Waterfront/Renfrew Riverside.&quot;The road bridge is another key project, which will bring benefits to both sides of the Clyde.&quot;###
240|||FURIOUS residents attacked a plan to charge them for parking outside their own homes when a new hospital is opened. Residents hit out at plan to charge them for parking in street FURIOUS residents attacked a plan to charge them for parking outside their own homes when a new hospital is opened.Yesterday the Evening Times exclusively revealed Glasgow City Council was considering a pay-to-park scheme in the areas around the new Southern General Hospital.The plan is expected to cost each householder &pound;50 a year for a permit to park in their street.One local resident said he would refuse to pay.Brian MacAtemey, 47, unemployed, from Linthouse said: &quot;If you pay road tax why should you have to pay extra money to park outside your own house.&quot;The &pound;842million hospital campus will provide 2800 spaces for its 10,000 staff, patients and visitors when it opens next year.Tricia Maguire, 36, a full- time mum from Drumoyne said: &quot;I've got two kids who go to the local nursery and I'm a single parent.&quot;Our money is getting cut and we are not getting as much benefits so I don't have that kind of money.&quot;My mum works and stays local - it's bad enough in her street at the moment with everyone who has cars.&quot;The cost hit a sour note with Stacey McCullagh, 32, a customer service represen-tative from Linthouse.She said: &quot;We have got two cars plus a van, that's three vehicles to our household.&quot;Is it going to be priced per car, per year, or just for one household? It could work out quite costly. If it's one space for each house and we have three, it's going to be a joke.&quot;The top floor of the car park will be completed in 2016, adding an extra 700 bays.But until then staff, patients and visitors will have access to only 2800 spaces as well as the areas around the building.Ronald McCullagh, 30, a milkman from Linthouse, said: &quot;As it is, it can be pretty tight in this street on any given day. When the bowling club is on it's even worse.&quot;With this coming in to play it will just be 100 times worse.&quot;It's just going to be chaos, I thought they were going to be having a big car park, aren't 3000 spaces going to be enough?&quot;While most residents were outraged, one local woman thought the plans could mean safer streets.Margaret Reid, 55, retired, from Linthouse said: &quot;I think it's an excellent idea.&quot;An awful lot of folk here don't have cars so it's just maybe one or two to each number, it's good and it could be safer.&quot;She also agreed that while the cost might put some people off, it wasn't too expensive.She added: &quot;&pound;50 a year wouldn't bother me because that's only &pound;1 a week. If you pay quarterly people will be more agreeable but if they say &pound;50 down payment there and then a lot of people will say it's too expensive, but really it's only a pound a week.&quot;A traffic assessment has been carried out and measures aimed at avoiding roads chaos were identified, which include improving public transport services and upgrading cycling and walking routes in the area.Consultation events are to be held at Elder Park Library on October 23 and 24 from 10am to 5pm and October 25 between 10am and 3pm.These will give residents the opportunity to raise concerns and have their say on the designs for the plans.###

Extra off-sales mean early deaths for city residents ALCOHOL related death rates are 72% higher in areas of Glasgow with the highest number of off-sales, a study has found.The research backs up previous claims that over-provision of alcohol licences, which drives down prices, is the main source of problem drinking.People who live in the Merchant City area, including the Saltmarket and Gallowgate, are three times more likely to be admitted to hospital with booze related problems, including liver disease and alcohol poisoning.Residents have access to 36 off-sales, compared with an average of 8.6 city-wide, and 301 licensed premises including bars, restaurants and clubs.The area around Sauchiehall Street had the second highest number of off-licenses, including supermarkets, at 34, with 307 licensed premises in total.Alcohol-related hospital admission rates in the city were 50% above the Scottish average.The highest number of off-sales was recorded in Edinburgh, with 54 in one area of the city.The Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh compared the number of alcohol outlets within Scottish neighbourhoods with records of alcohol-related hospitalisations and deaths.Across Scotland, there were 34 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people in neighbourhoods with the most off-sales outlets, compared with 13 per 100,000 in areas with the fewest outlets.Researchers said the lack of attention paid to the link between off-licence provision and alcohol-related harm had been a &quot;serious oversight,&quot; and called on local authorities to tackle the issue.Licensing chiefs also called on the Scottish Government to re-examine the laws on over-provision.Figures from 2011-2012 show the city of Glasgow had 518 off sales, with a total of 1748 licences premises.Scotland has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related harm in Western Europe.Across Glasgow, there were 2622 alcohol-related deaths from 2002-2011.Dr Evelyn Gillan, Chief Executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, which released the report, said: &quot;If we want fewer people to end up in hospital or lose their lives because of alcohol, then we have to be concerned about the high number of alcohol outlets in our neighbourhoods.&quot;Licensing boards have a key role to play in regulating the overall number of licensed premises and their decisions should be informed by studies such as this.&quot;Paul Waterson, Chief Executive of The Scottish Licensed Trade, said: &quot;We would tend to agree with the report. Councils have to have over-provision policies in place that work.&quot; We would urge the Scottish Government to re-examine the law on over-provision.&quot;A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: &quot;The board has a robust policy on over-provision of licences, which seeks to manage the availability of alcohol across the city while respecting the rights of the licensed trade.&quot;The board has identified 14 over-provided areas in the city, where there is a presumption against further licences being issued, with four other areas on a watch list.&quot;However, depending on the merits of an individual case, the board retains the right to refuse any liquor licence application on the basis of overprovision.&quot;Plans to introduce a minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland could be delayed for years as the Scottish Government fights a series of legal challenges from the drinks industry.caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
242|||BEST selling crime writer Martina Cole went behind bars in Glasgow - but not to get tips for her latest novel. Crime-writer Martina Cole takes book project to prisons BEST selling crime writer Martina Cole went behind bars in Glasgow - but not to get tips for her latest novel.The award-winning author, who has published 18 books and sold around 10 million worldwide, is spearheading a campaign to boost literacy and reawaken the nation's love of reading.She is talking to inmates at Shotts Prison today, and was at Barlinnie yesterday, as part of The Reading Agency's Six Book Challenge.It aims to encourage lapsed or less confident readers to commit to reading six texts, from short magazine pieces to novels, to help boost literacy and numeracy skills.The challenge, now in its eighth year, has been taken up by the two prisons and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with nurses at Inverclyde's sterilising service joining a workplace book group.Staff at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley have also joined up.Martina, who is an ambassador for the challenge, said: &quot;A lot of people haven't read since they were at school. It's about getting them back to reading for pleasure.&quot;A lot of the prisoners are very intelligent but they just haven't learned to read. It's very sad to see.&quot;Martina believes passionately in improving literacy in prisons and said it could, literally, change lives.She added: &quot;If prisoners learn to read, that could give them confidence to apply for a job, for example.&quot;I always say, if you can't read your own name, you can't write it on an application form.&quot;Around 50 prisoners at Barlinnie completed the Six Book Challenge this year and the prison was given a bronze award by the Reading Agency.Martina said best-selling novels and autobiographies were popular with inmates and that many of the prisoners had read her books and talked to her about them.She said: &quot;They have strong, powerful women characters, who are popular. It's all about an escape from real life.&quot;It's nice for them to be able to meet the author who wrote the book they read.&quot;Martina began visiting prisons when scenes from one of her earlier novels - The Jump - were being filmed at London's Wandsworth Prison.She said: &quot;It was in the early 90s and I was asked to give a talk to the prisoners.&quot;I think libraries are so important in prisons, what they are doing with creative classes. I got involved with them and it snowballed from there.&quot;Genevieve Clarke, of the Six Book Challenge, said workplace schemes were ideal to encourage more people to start reading again.She said: &quot;They are quite inclusive, particularly in prisons.&quot;Prisons are absolutely key to the challenge. The prison libraries, together with education services, are making it happen. A large number of people in prison are completely turned off reading, or they have poor literacy skills, so this is a way of trying to support them. They can start with anything, it can be a really short story, just to get them engaged and motivated.&quot;Martina left school at 15 with no qualifications. She's living proof that, if she can do it, anyone can.&quot;More than 40,000 people have completed the Six Book Challenge, including 156 staff at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, who were yesterday given a gold award by the Reading Agency.See www.sixbookchallenge.org.uk for more informationvictoria.brenan@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

246|||COUNCILS should be given the power to write off rent arrears caused by the 'bedroom tax', said Labour's welfare spokeswoman. Write off 'bedroom tax' rent arrears, says MSP COUNCILS should be given the power to write off rent arrears caused by the 'bedroom tax', said Labour's welfare spokeswoman.Jackie Baillie said local authorities needed help to deal with the debts and people in arrears should have the &quot;cloud lifted&quot;.After the First Minister revealed plans to scrap historic poll tax debts by banning councils from pursuing debtors, Ms Baillie asked what help would be available to councils to pay off any bedroom tax arrears from the year before the Scottish Government provided extra cash to top up payments to those affected.Mr Salmond said Finance Secretary John Swinney would address the issue this week in his budget, but did not say how.Ms Baillie has since received an answer to the same question from Margaret Burgess, the housing minister.Ms Baillie had asked whether local authorities have been advised that they can cancel arrears of the so-called 'bedroom tax' arising in 2013-14 and when the Scottish Government will issue guidance on the matter.Ms Burgess said when the cap is lifted councils can top up the payments which will mean no-one will have to pay the shortfall if they claim and are granted a Discre-tionary Housing Payments (DHP). However, she said arrears from the previous year were a matter for landlords.She said: &quot;The manage-ment of arrears, including those related to the bedroom tax, is a matter for landlords as part of their respon-sibility. The cap for DHP will be lifted once the power to do so is transferred to Scottish Ministers.&quot;When that happens, local authorities will be able to top up their DHP accounts to make any further payments in line with local priorities.&quot;Ms Baillie said Mr Swinney must deal with it &quot;decisively&quot; in his budget. She said: &quot;People living under the threat of the collection of bedroom tax arrears need and deserve clarity, which the First Minister failed to give them on Thursday.&quot;When local authorities are facing crippling budget pressures as a result of the council tax freeze, it is incumbent on the Scottish Government to provide assistance to hard-pressed councils so they can deal with these debts.&quot;As John Swinney prepares for his Budget it is incumbent on him to act decisively on this issue.&quot;They must lift the cloud for those struggling to cope with this debt.&quot;stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
247|||THE Conservatives have been accused of "lying" over claims they can reduce the deficit without raising taxes. Tory promises over tax are a lie, claims Cable THE Conservatives have been accused of "lying" over claims they can reduce the deficit without raising taxes.Business Secretary Vince Cable said his coalition partners are trying to &quot;balance the books on the backs of the poor.&quot;Speaking at the Liberal Democrats UK Party Conference in Glasgow, Mr Cable attacked the Tories on the economy and for heaping the debt burden on poorer people.He said more taxes were needed and some borrowing should be looked, as the cost was historically low.Mr Cable said: &quot;Any politician who tells you that the next Government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you.&quot;He said welfare cuts were damaging and he would not support them.He added: &quot;The need for budget discipline mustn't become an obsession with ever deeper cuts.&quot;Key public services have already been cut to the bone.&quot;The Tories are ideologically obsessed by cuts because they see it as a way of destroying public service and the welfare state, which they detest.&quot;The Tories' proposal to take another &pound;25 billion or more out of welfare and unprotected Government departments will do great harm to valuable services.&quot;I will categorically not go along with this.&quot;So you might ask what is the alternative?&quot;The truth is, more taxes will be needed to contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities.&quot;He called for cash to be allocated for building projects, even if the money had to be borrowed.He added: &quot;There is a role too for more public borrowing by central and local government to finance productive investment in transport, housing and innovation.&quot;When interest rates are so low, borrowing for investment is a no-brainer and is nothing to do with deficit reduction.&quot;Of course we need to protect the next generation from too much public as well as private debt, but the next generation would certainly not thank us for a legacy of under investment, over-stretched infrastructure and unaffordable homes.&quot;Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said more powers would be delivered to Scotland with no strings attached and that the same could happen in Wales too.He also called for English cities and regions to be given greater autonomy.He said: &quot;When we deliver, and we will, no ifs, no buts, no caveats, no conditions imposed by David Cameron and the Conservative Party, what is in effect home rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom, I think we should aspire to deliver home rule to Wales as well.&quot;Mr Clegg also called for greater decentralisation of powers to English cities and regions, backing a report from councils in the north of England, calling for investment in transport infrastructure, including a high-speed trans-Pennine rail link and improvements to motorways.stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
248|||FAMILIES affected by a C.diff outbreak that led to the deaths of 28 patients will finally get some answers next month. Superbug hospital report due FAMILIES affected by a C.diff outbreak that led to the deaths of 28 patients will finally get some answers next month.The findings of a delayed &pound;10million inquiry into the outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital will be revealed next month, more than five years after it was commissioned.Lord MacLean, chairman of the inquiry, has written to Health Secretary Alex Neil to advise that his report will be published on November 24 and Mr Neil has informed the Scottish Parliament.The inquiry was set up in 2009 to investigate the treatment of 63 patients at the hospital in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, between December 1, 2007, and June 1, 2008. Of the 31 patients who died during this period, C.diff has been identified as a contributory factor in 28 of the deaths.The report had originally been due to be made public by the end of May, 2011, but has been repeatedly delayed due to factors including a period of illness suffered by the chairman.A fifth delay announced in February pushed back a publication date of March, 2014, because the inquiry was still waiting for responses to warning letters issued to those likely to be the subject of criticism.Last week Jackie Baillie MSP raised a motion calling on Health Secretary Alex Neil to ensure the findings of the report were published &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.She said: &quot;Significant delays in reporting have caused untold damage to the families who lost loved ones almost seven years ago. Five years after it was announced families are going through the pain of their loved ones' deaths, without answers.&quot;Her plea was backed by the campaign group, C.Diff Families Justice Group, which was set up by Michelle McGinty, whose mother-in-law died in the superbug outbreak.The inquiry has looked at other outbreaks of C.diff infection to make its recommendations. It does not have any power to determine civil or criminal liability in relation to the outbreak.caroline.wilson@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

253|||SHOCKINGLY two out of three people would hesitate to help a child who appeared lost or upset for fear of being falsely accused. First project aimed at keeping children safe SHOCKINGLY two out of three people would hesitate to help a child who appeared lost or upset for fear of being falsely accused.Results from a survey by the NSPCC revealed 64% of the population admitted they would be too afraid to step in if they felt a child was in danger.But Scotland's leading charity Children 1st is changing that by empowering communities to protect their youngsters.Almost 5000 people across the city have already been given the tools and confidence to make their communities safer for their kids thanks to sessions run by the charity's Glasgow Communities Putting Children First project.Around 40 volunteers have signed up to take the message into communities after an intense eight-week training course.They offer one-hour interactive sessions to communities, businesses and educational establish-ments and five-minute talks at events across the city.Project team leader Theresa Marsilli said: &quot;Child protection is everyone's responsibility.&quot;We find that we get really good outcomes when volunteers from local areas give talks about how they can safeguard children's welfare because there are some relationships there, they have a lot in common and understand the issues families are facing. These volunteers can make more of a difference and commun-ities respond well to them because they know they are doing it out of goodwill.&quot;It's not their job, they just want to help and care about the children and the parents living in the area.&quot;We have 35 volunteers across Glasgow from all different backgrounds and ages but we are always looking for more.&quot;Hundreds of groups including schools, nurs-eries, colleges, hotels and other businesses have already had one-hour awareness sessions through the Glasgow Communities Putting Children First, which is largely funded by the People's Postcode lottery.The community engage-ment project gives people the tools to help a child in distress or in danger without putting themselves at risk.Children 1st has come up with a simple guide, in leaflet and pocket form, for everyone to follow if they see or know of a child who needs help. They call it the five Ds which includes direct support, distract, delegate, delay and don't turn a blind eye.Mum-of-two Theresa, 40, said: &quot;During the community engagement sessions it is interactive.&quot;It is not about us going out and telling people what to do, it's about getting communities involved as much as we can and taking that responsibility.&quot;It is about creating a space for people to have a dialogue where they can tell us how they feel about offering support and knowing that it's OK to feel nervous about that. It is not an easy thing to do.&quot;We don't want people to put themselves at risk but they need to do something.&quot;The message is clear - whatever you do, don't do nothing. There is always something you can do.&quot;Three months after a community engagement session, volunteers contact them again to ask if they have put anything they learned into practice and so far 80% of the people asked to give feedback now feel more confident about taking action to help a child.Aileen Kenny, from Children 1st, is concen-trating her efforts on getting the message across to train operators Network Rail and ScotRail because many incidents go unchallenged on public transport because people are too scared to act.She said: &quot;It's all about going empowering people and letting them know there is something they can do to help.&quot;Volunteer Lynn McLeod, 38, a social care lecturer at Glasgow Clyde College, began giving child safety sessions last January.She said it has given her a confidence boost and a new lease of life because she knows she is giving something back to the community.Lynn said: &quot;An advert came into the college for students to volunteer and I jumped at the chance.&quot;It's something I've always wanted to do and it has given me more confidence.&quot;janice.burns@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
254|||Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man who was critically injured during a "horrific attack" in a Glasgow street last week died in hospital. 'Horrific attack' on Stephen McGinlay now murder probe Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man who was critically injured during a &quot;horrific attack&quot; in a Glasgow street last week died in hospital.
Stephen McGinlay, 26, from the city's Possilpark area, was attacked, along with a friend, by three men on St George's Road, at 17:50 on Thursday.
Mr McGinlay was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he died on Sunday. 
The three suspects were seen in a dark coloured car. They are in their 20s and were wearing dark clothing.
Police said the attack took place as Mr McGinlay and his friend were walking near Woodside Library on St George's Road.
The three suspects got out from a dark-coloured car parked nearby. It is believed they used the car to leave the scene.
Det Ch Insp Bob Frew, of the major investigation team, said: &quot;Extensive inquiries are ongoing in relation to this incident and officers are continuing to study CCTV footage in an effort to gather more information on whoever is responsible for this horrific attack.
&quot;This area is extremely popular and would have been busy with both motorists and pedestrians at the time of the incident. 
&quot;I am sure that there are some witnesses to this assault who have not yet come forward to police, and I would urge anyone with information that may assist police inquiries to contact officers as a matter of urgency.&quot;
Police said a post mortem examination would take place on Tuesday to establish how Mr McGinlay died.###

Temporary roof fitted at fire-hit Glasgow School of Art A temporary roof is being installed on Glasgow School of Art's fire-damaged Mackintosh building in a bid to keep it wind and watertight over the winter.
The week-long operation will see a large metal frame hoisted on to the building on Tuesday before white protective panels are fitted.
The Grade-A listed structure has dried out over the summer since fire crews battled to contain a blaze on 23 May.
The art school hopes to raise &pound;20m to restore the iconic building.
Firefighters managed to save about 90% of the structure and 70% of its contents, although the Mackintosh library was among the most badly-damaged areas.
Glasgow School of Art (GSA) is hosting two symposia to explore key questions around the rebuilding of the historically important library.
One will be held in Venice on 18 October, in Querini Stampalia, during the 2014 International Venice Architecture Biennale.
The other will be held in Glasgow next spring.###
257|||Two major historical archives dealing with Scotland's industrial and maritime past are to be expanded with more than £500,000 of lottery funding. Textile and maritime collections get £500,000 grant boost Two major historical archives dealing with Scotland's industrial and maritime past are to be expanded with more than &pound;500,000 of lottery funding.
The Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine has been awarded &pound;412,000 to help it acquire more artwork.
Glasgow University's Scottish Business Archive will use &pound;91,800 to develop its collection of records on the Scottish textile industry dating back to 1800.
The Heritage Lottery Fund's Collecting Cultures programme made both awards. 
The aim of Collecting Cultures is to provide money for curators to develop their collections proactively rather than having to wait for a painting or object to become available on the market. 
It was developed as a one-off programme but proved so popular that the Heritage Lottery Fund has brought it back for a second time. 
The Scottish Maritime Museum's current collection includes 40 vessels, marine engines and shipbuilding machinery. 
The lottery funding will help it acquire more artwork, rather than more machinery and engineering exhibits, to help provide a wider interpretation of the maritime industry's importance in Scotland. 
Acquisitions will include oil paintings, sketches, sculpture studies, photographs and posters, dating from 1750 onwards. 
Glasgow University will use its grant to develop the textile section of its Scottish Business Archive.
It aims to add items such as fabric sample books, catalogues, industry tools, theatre costumes and clothes made from 19th and 20th century textiles. 
The university also aims to make its archive more accessible through training, exhibitions and digital resources.
Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: &quot;Collecting Cultures is a ground-breaking scheme which evolved after a great many discussions with galleries, libraries and archives to find out how we could best support their long-term strategic development. 
&quot;We are delighted to make these awards today and commend the projects for their plans to increase public involvement and enjoyment of their collections.&quot;###
258|||An artist from Glasgow has been described as the "Wilfred Owen of cartooning" following the rediscovery of his World War One work. Glasgow's 'Wilfred Owen of cartooning' rediscovered after 100 years An artist from Glasgow has been described as the &quot;Wilfred Owen of cartooning&quot; following the rediscovery of his World War One work.
Archie Gilkison's war cartoons appeared in newspapers including the Herald and Evening Times.
It was published from 1914 until his death in 1916.
According to a Glasgow University expert, his style is highly unusual in displaying anti-war sentiment while the conflict was ongoing.
The university now plans to exhibit and research Gilkison's work.
Cartoons often appeared in the newly influential popular press which sold hundreds of thousands of copies a day, and were widely used during WW1 as a propaganda tool to keep morale high among the civilian population. 
Gilkison's work as a journalist and cartoonist appeared in newspapers across the UK from the early 1900s. 
When Britain went to war with Germany in 1914, he contributed cartoons - drawn with pen and ink - regularly to the then Glasgow Herald and the Evening Times.
The flow of creativity ended when Gilkison, who suffered ill-health throughout his life, died of pneumonia, aged 31 while in military training at Berwick in 1916, after being conscripted into the army. He never made it to the front line.
He is the only cartoonist of the time I know who evokes an anti-war sentiment during the war itself”
For almost 100 years, Gilkison's cartoons remained largely forgotten outside his family.
They were brought to the university's attention a few weeks ago by his great-great niece, who thought they may be of interest during the 100-year commemorations of the start of the war.
According to Prof Laurence Grove, director of the university's Stirling Maxwell Centre for the study of text and image, the cartoons are a major find due to the quality of the penmanship and the unusual approach to the conflict.
He said: &quot;Archie Gilkison's work is an astounding discovery.
&quot;Through him we live the war first hand. He is the only cartoonist of the time I know who evokes an anti-war sentiment during the war itself. He could be for cartooning what Wilfred Owen was for poetry.&quot;
Prof Laurence Grove, University of Glasgow
The Reason Why, below right, depicts a stark view of a fallen soldier, his skull-like head face down, with the birds of death circling above - it is in marked contrast to the depiction of the war both sides were used to seeing.
Gilkison's soldier is a far cry from those depicted in works such as The Integrity of Belgium, by British artist Walter Sickert, which shows a resplendent soldier in shining blue uniform, or glory-peddling allegories such as Charles Butler's Blood and Iron.
Like the Renaissance symbols that came before him and the 21st century ads that followed, Gilkison manipulates the interaction between title, image, and meaning: here, the Kaiser's promise to &quot;never retreat&quot; is depicted as an ironic premonition of German massacre.
Gilkison's stark anti-war patriotism is the forgotten forerunner of the Why? posters from the Vietnam War.
Gilkison's family has donated a rare book of his work to the Stirling Maxwell Centre and Prof Grove intends to include his cartoons in a major exhibition of text and image being staged by the university in 2015.
Marianne Taylor, Gilkison's great-great niece and a journalist at BBC Scotland, said: &quot;Archie's family couldn't be more thrilled that his work has finally been recognised. For generations we have enjoyed looking at his cartoons and it's wonderful to think that others will now have the chance to see and study them too.
&quot;It's particularly poignant that Archie died in training after being conscripted - in this day and age he would never have been sent to war. But it's wonderful that his work will be kept alive for the future, in the city he loved.&quot;
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow added: &quot;We are delighted to receive this generous gift of Archie Gilkison's work. 
&quot;This gift adds a rare World War One document of international importance to our collections in the Stirling Maxwell Centre, which are already noted as being amongst the strongest in the world for text and image cultures.&quot;###
259|||For five generations he has been something of a family legend - artist, poet, journalist and, ultimately, victim of a terrible war. My great uncle, the Wilfred Owen of cartooning For five generations he has been something of a family legend - artist, poet, journalist and, ultimately, victim of a terrible war.
For as long as I can remember I've been intrigued by Archie Gilkison and his work, and now it seems the talent of this World War One cartoonist from Glasgow, my great-great uncle, will be appreciated by a wider audience.
Following his death in 1916, Archie's cartoons were all but forgotten outside the family. 
But this changed when, inspired by the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the war, I took a book of my ancestor's work to an expert at the University of Glasgow.
It turns out Archie's cartoons, which appeared regularly in papers such as the Glasgow Herald and Evening Times from 1914 to 1916, are of international importance and offer a very different depiction of war than others of the time. 
He's even been called the &quot;Wilfred Owen of cartooning&quot;- a wonderful accolade for this shy, modest but very talented man, my great-grandmother's little brother. 
Born in Dumbarton in 1885 to a humble but artistic family - his father was a poet and two of his brothers were writers - Archie was educated in the west of Scotland and Northern Ireland.
After being apprenticed to a firm of document writers in Glasgow, he wrote and cartooned - under the nickname Baldy - for newspapers including the then Glasgow Herald, the Evening Times, the Courier, Scots Pictorial, London Opinion and the Bristol Echo. He spent some time in the US - writing widely in the Scottish press about his experiences - and was himself a prolific poet.
But, it was as a cartoonist that his talent really shone through, particularly following the outbreak of war in 1914.
Cartoons featured prominently in the popular press, which grew massively in circulation and influence during the war. Newspapers were the internet and television of their age, and would have the only source of news about the war for many. 
Newspapers sold millions of copies a day and cartoons were a key part of the propaganda machine that sought to keep morale high on the home front.
The quality of Archie's drawing is apparent even to the untrained eye. The detail is extraordinary - faces, helmets, moustaches, uniforms, ships, battlefields, all drawn beautifully and with flair in pen and ink.
But it's the sophisticated mix of humour, patriotism, despair and outrage that equally strikes a chord, from Santa Claus struggling to make his deliveries to the trenches at Christmas 1915, to frustration at the US for being slow to enter the war, to a very accurate premonition of how Germany would be viewed by the rest of the world if and when it lost the war.
Another stark drawing, which looks 50 years ahead of its time in style, depicts a dead German soldier lying in a trench.
Being a journalist myself, I know what it's like to work to tight deadlines and often Archie would have had just a few hours to develop the concept for the cartoon, draw it with absolute precision and file it to his editors.
To be able to do this with such flair, elegance and sophistication is massively impressive.
And, it seems my respect for Archie's work is not just family bias.
Prof Laurence Grove, an expert in the history of cartoons and director of the Stirling Maxwell Centre for the study of text and image at the University of Glasgow, become an instant admirer of my great-great uncle when I showed him a book that had not been seen outside the family for almost 100 years.
&quot;Archie Gilkison's work is an astounding discovery,&quot; he said. &quot;Through him we live the war first hand.&quot;
&quot;He is the only cartoonist I know who evokes an anti-war sentiment during the war itself. He could be for cartooning what Wilfred Owen was for poetry.
&quot;This is a find of international importance. His style is extremely fine and erudite - it has references to textual engravings of the 16th and 17th century, Shakespeare and history, and he throws in a bit of fun - he gives us Nessie as well.
&quot;Archie does for cartooning what Wilfred Owen did for poetry - he puts it into a different perspective, one which people just didn't get at the time.&quot; 
And why were cartoons important to the war effort?
&quot;Pictures in general played a huge role in the propaganda machine, with governments sponsoring official images that would help the cause,&quot; Prof Grove explained. 
&quot;On a popular level it was the high circulation illustrated journals - a relatively new phenomenon - that moulded the mind of the public.
&quot;Here in Britain, cartoons were a key part of the divertissement, providing light entertainment and avoiding the horrors of the war.&quot;
So Archie, although patriotic, is unusual in that he depicts the darkness of war more honestly than other cartoonists of the time. Underlying his work is criticism, rather than glorification, of battle.
Prof Grove plans to use Archie's work in a major exhibition on cartoons through the ages to be hosted by the university next year. 
And the cartoons will also now have a permanent home in the archive at the University of Glasgow, Archie's home city.
Archie would have been so proud, I'm sure, as would my wonderful grandmother, who used to tell me all about her talented uncle when I was a child, though she herself never met him.
So, what happened to Archie? Ironically, the war that heralded his artistic peak was also his undoing.
Despite suffering ill-health throughout most of his life, Archie was conscripted to the Royal Scots in October 1916 and sent to training in Berwick.
A chill he caught developed into pneumonia and he died aged 31 on 2 November of that year. He never made it to the front line.
His family were devastated, and according to Archie's friend and biographer John Willoughby Bird, the Scottish journalism profession mourned his loss bitterly.
In a poem to accompany a watercolour he did of a Scottish soldier piping his comrades over the top, Archie wrote: &quot;I heard the piper blaw/Wi my ain een I saw/What ye can never knaw/For I was Fey wha followed.&quot;
In Scots, &quot;fey&quot; means fated to die, and in these sad lines Archie seems to predict his own fate as well as that of so many of his generation.
As I get older I become even more fond of Archie and his work - niece to uncle, journalist to journalist. We even worked for some of the same newspapers, a century apart.
I'm so proud that his beautiful, biting, clever cartoons will live on for generations to come.###
260|||A new documentary explores the internment of Scots sailors in a camp in neutral Holland shortly after the outbreak of World War One. Insights into WW1's HMS Timbertown A new documentary explores the internment of Scots sailors in a camp in neutral Holland shortly after the outbreak of World War One.
The men included 102 from Lewis, while others came from the Northern Isles, Wick, Avoch, Glasgow, Fife and Barra.
They were among 1,500 members of the Royal Naval Division held in a camp dubbed HMS Timbertown.
BBC Alba's documentary of the same name draws on Admiralty records to tell the stories of its Scots' inmates.
The Royal Naval Division was set up by Winston Churchill when he was lord of the Admiralty.
In October 1914, the division was caught up in the fall of Antwerp following a month-long siege by German troops.
Following Germany's invasion of Belgium in August 1914, Antwerp had sheltered the Belgian's King Albert I, along with his government, civilians and thousands of soldiers, including elements of the British Expeditionary Force.
After the city and its fortifications fell, the men of the Royal Naval Division crossed into Holland to evade capture.
They reached the town of Groningen where the authorities had a camp of wooden huts built to hold them until the end of the war.
In the documentary, BBC Alba's Angela MacLean retraces the sailors' journey and recounts the experiences of the Lewis men in the camp.
Interred with them were men from all over Scotland and the rest of the UK and included fishermen, an actor, a burglar and the Duchess of Cambridge's great grandfather, Frederick Glassborow.
There were escape attempts and deaths from illnesses in the camp.
Football matches and cabaret shows organised by the men were watched by local people, who were allowed, on occasions, to visit.
Some of the sailors were allowed to return to the UK on leave for family funerals and even to help with take in harvests on farms and crofts, on condition they came back to the camp.
HMS Timbertown will be shown on BBC Alba on Thursday from 21:00.###
261|||Police investigating an assault and attempted robbery at a shop in West Dunbartonshire have released CCTV images of a man they want to trace. CCTV images appeal over Dumbarton shop raid attack Police investigating an assault and attempted robbery at a shop in West Dunbartonshire have released CCTV images of a man they want to trace.
The incident took place at McDermid's newsagent, on High Street, Dumbarton, at about 06:35 on 17 May this year. 
The suspect is described as white, aged between 18 and 23, about 5ft 2in tall and of thin build with a local accent. 
At the time of the raid he was wearing a dark grey waterproof jacket which had the hood up.
The jacket had lighter coloured patches on both shoulders and a white logo on the left breast.
The suspect was also wearing dark grey coloured trousers with lighter coloured bands on the sides, a football scarf covering the lower half of his face and was carrying a dark rucksack.
Det Con Stevie Monaghan, of Police Scotland, said: &quot;At that time of day, the shop is busy with local people picking up their morning paper, therefore, I would urge anyone who may have been in the area to contact officers as they may have information that could assist with our inquiry.&quot;###

263|||A consultation is to be held over proposed measures to cut anti-social behaviour and vandalism in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. Consultation over Loch Lomond camping bylaw proposals A consultation is to be held over proposed measures to cut anti-social behaviour and vandalism in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.
The park authority has proposed measures including bylaws banning camping without a permit at some popular loch shores, alongside a &pound;10m investment in campsites.
A meeting of the board warned parts of the park are being &quot;severely damaged&quot; by over-use and anti-social campers.
The consultation runs until 12 January.
There has been a marked reduction in problems at East Loch Lomond since similar measures were introduced there three years ago, with an 81% drop in antisocial behaviour recorded.
However, littering, fire damage, abandoned campsites and summer-long caravan encampments setting up in laybys remain an issue in other parts of the park.
To combat this, seasonal bylaws have been proposed for the west side of Loch Lomond, the north-east tip of Loch Long and many lochs in the Trossachs.
These would make it an offence to camp outside of authorised sites without a permit, or to cause damage to the area or wildlife.
Kevin Lilburn, chairman of the East Loch Lomond Visitor Management group, said the scheme in place there has made a huge difference.
He said: &quot;Previously we suffered some sort of incident at my home pretty much every weekend in the summer, including litter, theft, vandalism and verbal or even physical intimidation. 
&quot;Since the bylaws have been introduced, there have been none. Not one. That speaks for itself and official statistics tell a similar story.
&quot;We have gone from a situation where my neighbours and I dreaded sunny days to one in which we can relax, enjoy where we live, and happily share the area with responsibly behaved visitors.&quot;
The two proposed &quot;management zones&quot;, combined with the existing one at East Loch Lomond, would amount to less than 5% of the 720 square miles the park covers.
Fiona Logan, chief executive of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority, said the plans being put out for consultation were &quot;unashamedly ambitious&quot;.
She said: &quot;The park is within an hour's drive of more than 50% of Scotland's population, and this gives us specific problems, which, despite our best efforts, have been escalating.
&quot;The package of measures we are proposing has been developed in conjunction with partners and local communities and reflects our wholesale commitment to dramatically improving the experience of the Park for both residents and visitors.&quot;
The &quot;Your Park&quot; consultation will begin on 13 October and run until January.
The authority is seeking input from &quot;individuals, landowners, businesses, community enterprises and charities&quot; who may be interested in setting up or running new facilities.
This would be supported by &pound;10m from the park authority, which has already identified potential sites for additional camping, campervans and motor homes.###
264|||Camping could be severely restricted in parts of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park under new proposals from the park's board. New Loch Lomond park camping crackdown bylaws proposed Camping could be severely restricted in parts of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park under new proposals from the park's board.
Seasonal bylaws banning unauthorised camping and alcohol were introduced to parts of east Loch Lomond in 2011.
The park's board now want to bring in bylaws at two more areas in response to littering and anti-social behaviour.
The proposals will be put before the park's board next week ahead of a public consultation.
A report which will go before the National Park Authority on Monday details the &quot;resounding success&quot; of the existing bylaw system.
Vandalism and reports of anti-social behaviour are down 81% in the regulated areas.
The report continues that there remain &quot;entrenched problems&quot; at popular loch shore locations in the wider park, which have been left in &quot;a very poor and deteriorating state&quot;.
Anti-social behaviour noted from some visitors includes littering, &quot;cutting down live trees and irresponsible fire lighting&quot;.
Campers who set up caravans and campsites for months on end were also identified as an issue.
In response to this, it is proposed that camping management bylaws be introduced to two new areas, covering many lochs in the Trossachs, much of the west side of Loch Lomond and the north-east tip of Loch Long.
The bylaws, which would make it an offence to camp outside authorised sites without a permit or to cause damage to the area or wildlife, would be accompanied by investment in new facilities.
They would be in effect from 1 March to 31 October each year, applying only to &quot;concentrated areas of entrenched pressures&quot; - which the report notes would cover less than 5% of the park's 720 square miles.
Richard Graham, who runs a tourism business in St Fillians, said the proposals are a &quot;very positive step forward&quot;.
&quot;We'd rather see people educated, but unfortunately I think the people who work here, including park rangers and the police, are fairly powerless to do anything,&quot; he said.
&quot;There needs to be a line over which people can't step.&quot;
However Helen Todd, campaigns manager for Ramblers Scotland, said she was &quot;shocked&quot; by how wide-spread the proposals were.
&quot;I've talked to the park authority and we share the same desires for how to manage these places and I have a lot support for the work they're doing,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I really don't buy the case that they need bylaws to bring these into effect.
&quot;In terms of setting precedents, we've seen it spreading across the park, and I'd imagine there are communities in other parts of Scotland where people will be thinking they need them too. 
&quot;Bit by bit this fantastic access legislation we have is being whittled away.&quot;###
265|||Manager Ronny Deila still believes Celtic are "progressing" despite suffering their second Scottish Premiership defeat of the season. Manager Ronny Deila 'not worried' by Celtic form  Manager Ronny Deila still believes Celtic are &quot;progressing&quot; despite suffering their second Scottish Premiership defeat of the season. 
 Ali Crawford's strike gave Hamilton Academical their first win at Celtic Park since 1938. 
 &quot;I'm not worried at all,&quot; said Norwegian Deila. &quot;When you have 10 to 15 chances, you have played quite well. 
 &quot;With so many chances, you should win the game, no question. But of course you need to put the ball in the net.&quot; 
 Celtic dominated the first half and had several opportunities to equalise, including two headed chances for Anthony Stokes. 
 &quot;Sometimes football is like that,&quot; Deila said. 
 &quot;It's a very disappointing day. We had a lot of chances and didn't score one goal so that's unbelievably disappointing. 
 &quot;If we had done that we would've won the game quite easily, with so many chances you should win games. 
 &quot;We need determination to really want to get the ball into the net and today we had more to go in that. A little bit too sloppy, we need more accuracy and more determination. 
 &quot;To lose at home is nothing we want. We have to turn this around and bounce back next match. Still we are into everything and have opportunities to make a very good season. 
Celtic failed to score at home in a domestic match for the first time in over a year as Hamilton triumphed at Celtic Park
 &quot;I should hope there was a game in three days but now we have to wait 13 days to bounce back against Ross County.&quot; 
 Supporters were vocal in their disapproval at the final whistle but Deila said: &quot;I understand that. 
 &quot;We have to win games and today we didn't win and we should've done it. With those chances, you shouldn't lose games.&quot; ###

 When Kerr's Stirling University side host Albion Rovers in first round action, she will become the first female to lead out a team in the competition's 141-year history. 
 The former Arsenal Ladies boss is, however, keen to focus on the football. 
 &quot;It's a distraction and I've tried to keep the distraction so it's affecting me rather than the team,&quot; Kerr said. 
 &quot;I can understand it but for me I'm just doing my job. 
 &quot;It should never be about gender, it should be about skill set and, thankfully for me, I've had nothing but positivity surrounding my career in football. Long may that continue, although you know when results don't go in your favour that can change.&quot; 
 Albion Rovers have made a great start to the season under manager Darren Young, and currently sit second-top of League Two. 
 Stirling University, who appointed Kerr in August, are mid-table in the Scottish Lowland League after a solid start to their campaign. 
 And 44-year-old Kerr is hugely positive about the challenge her players face, against a side that stunned Motherwell in the competition last season and took Rangers to a replay before being knocked out by the Ibrox outfit in the quarter-finals. 
 &quot;Albion Rovers are flying, they're in a higher division than us so there's no expectation on us which is a good thing,&quot; Kerr told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;But we're on a decent run of form, we've got a young group of players and I'm sure they'll embrace the challenge. It's really exciting but if you're asking me to predict, I can't. 
 &quot;Our short term goal was to accumulate points in the Lowland League, which thankfully we've done. 
 &quot;We've built up a little bit of momentum just now so on Sunday it's an opportunity for us to switch off from the bread and butter of our own league and test ourselves against a higher opposition. 
 &quot;For our guys it's an opportunity to test themselves. Some of them have been in the professional environment previously so it's not that they have a point to prove, but I'm sure they'll want to give a good account of ourselves on the day. 
 &quot;We'll give it our best, make sure the guys are well prepared, and you never know in football.&quot; ###

 A 2-0 win for Spartans over Rangers means Glasgow are 12 points clear and now cannot be caught in the title race. 
 City's only league defeat - their first in almost six years - came against Spartans in September. 
 &quot;To win one title is difficult, to win eight in a row is truly historic,&quot; Glasgow boss Eddie Wolecki Black said. 
 City have already secured the League Cup this term, are in the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup and face Polish Champions Medyk Konin in the last 32 of the Champions League. 
 And Black believes his side's achievements are all the more impressive given the fact they have had to deal with a series of injuries to key players this term. 
 &quot;We did not win this title with 11 players, we won this with many people making vital contributions,&quot; he added. 
 &quot;There is no doubt that it has been a difficult season but when you add the League title to the League Cup then it is a very good season. 
 &quot;With such a heavy schedule there is barely time to celebrate but it does not stop me from acknowledging a remarkable achievement.&quot; ###
270|||Motherwell boss Stuart McCall accepts that his side are in a slump following their 3-1 defeat by Partick Thistle. Motherwell: Stuart McCall frustrated by slump  Motherwell boss Stuart McCall accepts that his side are in a slump following their 3-1 defeat by Partick Thistle. 
 The Lanarkshire side have won only won two of their nine Premiership matches this season, although McCall is hopeful they can mount a recovery. 
 &quot;We need a result to turn for us,&quot; said McCall. 
 &quot;We are where we deserve to be right now. We've just got to dig in, dig deep, have belief in each other and stick together.&quot; 
 Thistle's goals from Stuart Bannigan, Kris Doolan and Stephen O'Donnell compounded Motherwell's miserable start to the season, even though Lionel Ainsworth crashed in a 30-yard rocket for the visitors. 
 “Work-wise, organisation-wise, we just need people to step up to the plate” 
 The Steelmen are now languishing in second-bottom spot in the table after their second league defeat in succession, but McCall insists it is not down to a a drop in ambition from his players. 
 &quot;When things aren't going well, they're not going well,&quot; said McCall. 
 &quot;I don't think it was lack of effort or desire. We got done on a counter-attack goal and it gave them a lead. 
 &quot;I think when you're in a run like we are, you need to get the first goal, and we didn't do that. 
 &quot;We believed at half time we could come out and win the game - we got back in it, and we put corners in and forced pressure. 
 &quot;The crowd were behind us - but it was lack of communication, lack of organisation.&quot; 
 McCall also praised the club's fans for their continued support and insisted he was doing everything he could to turn the fortunes on the pitch around and reward their loyalty. 
 &quot;We got good backing again today. All I can say is rest assured, we're doing everything we can. 
 &quot;Work-wise, organisation-wise, we just need people to step up to the plate.&quot; ###
271|||St Mirren manager Tommy Craig said his younger players are demonstrating their credentials after a 2-1 win against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. St Mirren: Tommy Craig praises Buddies young team  St Mirren manager Tommy Craig said his younger players are demonstrating their credentials after a 2-1 win against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. 
 Adam Drury's late strike was the difference as St Mirren picked up their second win of the Premiership season. 
 &quot;Of the 18 players today, we had 15 under the age of 22,&quot; said Craig. 
 &quot;The young lad Adam showed fantastic composure. It was a good ball from Ross Caldwell, and a wonderful finish.&quot; 
 Jason Naismith's long-range shot opened the scoring for St Mirren in the 28th minute, but it was cancelled out by St Johnstone's Steven Anderson who headed in from a Lee Croft corner in the second half. 
 “St Mirren have dipped into the youth team and whenever I think about what we need at the back, middle or front - I look in the way before I look outwith the club” 
 St Mirren have relied heavily on players who have emerged from the club's youth system in recent months, but Craig insists the policy is finally paying off. 
 &quot;It's what we're all about,&quot; said Craig. &quot;St Mirren have dipped into the youth team and whenever I think about what we need at the back, middle or front - I look in the way before I look outwith the club. 
 &quot;I look at our youth development programme, and it's showing signs of fruition. 
 &quot;The young boys making their way in the game and learning how to go to places like Pittodrie and show the resilience they're going to need.&quot; 
 The win pushes St Mirren's points tally up to seven - all of which have come from away matches - but Craig admits that his players will need to start improving performances in Paisley if they are to make progress in the Premiership. 
 &quot;We've played better than we did today and lost,&quot; said Craig. 
 &quot;I thought we played okay, but there's been performances this season where we've deserved more than we got out of the game. I've said it to people, and now they might start to believe me. 
 &quot;It's seven very valuable points away from home, but we've got to brush up on our home form - that's crucial.&quot; ###
272|||Partick Thistle's 3-1 Scottish Premiership win over Motherwell was built on hard graft, argues the team's manager Alan Archibald. Hard graft the basis for Thistle win - Alan Archibald  Partick Thistle's 3-1 Scottish Premiership win over Motherwell was built on hard graft, argues the team's manager Alan Archibald. 
 &quot;I thought the lads worked ever so hard to win the second balls and do the ugly side of the game,&quot; the Jags boss told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;I thought we let ourselves down badly last week with the performance. 
 &quot;We didn't work hard enough and today we did do that and it allowed us to go and play and score some good goals.&quot; 
 Those goals came from Stuart Bannigan, Kris Doolan and Stephen O'Donnell, the latter after Lionel Ainsworth had pulled one back for Stuart McCall's struggling team. 
 “I thought the lads worked ever so hard to win the second balls and do the ugly side of the game” 
 &quot;It probably came at a time when we were dominating,&quot; Archibald said of Ainsworth's long-range strike. 
 &quot;The lads reacted really well. Motherwell are a hard team to defend against. They've got a lot of big guys and they put the ball in the box but credit to them [the Jags players] today, they held out. 
 &quot;It was a great team performance. 
 &quot;It's a great three points and gives us confidence. We go into the international break. 
 &quot;The lads have got a couple of days off and we get back to hard work and we go up to Tannadice with some confidence.&quot; ###
273|||Lewis Macleod marked his Rangers return with a magnificent overhead kick winner as the Ibrox side edged out Livingston.    Macleod 8′  
 Lewis Macleod marked his Rangers return with a magnificent overhead kick winner as the Ibrox side edged out Livingston. 
 The midfielder missed the last two weeks due to injury but took only eight minutes to make an impact, providing an acrobatic finish at the back post from Ian Black's lofted pass. 
 Rangers had chances to add to their tally but had to settle for one goal. 
 The result got the Ibrox men back to winning ways following their 3-1 defeat by Hibernian on Tuesday night. 
 That performance had left the Rangers faithful furious and their mood would have worsened if Livi's Danny Mullen had scored instead of firing over the bar after breaking through the visiting defence early on. 
 Macleod, however, eased any nerves in Ally McCoist's side with his sublime goal, showing no ill-effects from his recent ankle problems to beat goalkeeper Darren Jamieson. 
 Livi were forced into an early change after Craig Sives appeared to be knocked out cold when Nicky Law smashed a powerful shot straight into the defender's face from point-blank range, with Gary Glen on as his replacement. 
 Rangers went in 1-0 up at the break but a flashpoint among their fans in the stands during the opening 45 minutes would have been an unwelcome sight for club officials. 
 On the park, the visitors should have doubled their advantage early in the second period, but Kris Boyd's miserable luck in front of goal continued. 
 The former Scotland striker has yet to net in the league this season but thought his wait was over when Nicky Clark and Richard Foster combined to lay it on a plate for him six yards out. 
 Boyd's mortifying fresh-air swipe, however, summed up his afternoon and it was no surprise when he was hooked for Jon Daly soon after. 
 Clark had a bad miss of his own as he fired over from Lee Wallace's deep cross to the back post. 
 A stunning save by Jamieson was required to keep out McCulloch's volley from 10 yards with Rangers in full command by this point. 
 However, they were almost pegged back when Callum Fordyce crashed a 30-yard volley into the side-netting after an hour, while Jordan White screwed one wide soon after. 
 There was another scare when Black had to clear off his own goal-line after White looped a header over goalkeeper Steve Simonsen. 
 But Clark and Daly missed further chances to add gloss to the scoreline in the final 10 minutes as Rangers crawled over the line.

 Headed goals were the order of the day as Forfar levelled midway through the second period. Jim Paterson curled in a wicked ball for Dale Hilson to convert from the edge of the box.

 Brechin leapfrogged Morton and climbed into the top four thanks to a commanding victory over their League One rivals at Glebe Park. 
 Alan Trouten also joined Morton's Declan McManus at the top of the goalscoring charts, converting the 11th-minute penalty that put them in front after Sean Crighton was judged to have handballed in the area. 
 Robert Thomson doubled Brechin's advantage from Colin Hamilton's pass following a set-piece in the 33rd minute, leaving Morton with a mountain to climb in the second half. 
 Any hope of a comeback was ended in the 62nd minute when Kyle McAusland received Bobby Barr's pass with a supreme first touch and added a third goal. 
 Morton at least managed a consolation goal seven minutes later when Ricki Lamie set up Tommy O'Ware but Brechin held on comfortably.

277|||Peterhead did the damage in the space of six minutes midway through the second half as they saw off third-placed Ayr at Balmoor.    Stevenson 56′  Strachan 62′  
 Peterhead did the damage in the space of six minutes midway through the second half as they saw off third-placed Ayr at Balmoor. 
 There wasn't too much to excite The Blue Toon faithful in the first period, but affairs livened up after the interval when Jamie Stevenson fired Peterhead in front in the 56th minute. 
 Rory McAllister was the architect with a clever pass to the midfielder, who found the bottom-left corner. 
 Peterhead struck again shortly after when Ryan Strachan drove the ball past Davie Hutton following a fine pass by McAllister. 
 Having been competitive up to the first goal, Ayr floundered under the two-goal deficit and Peterhead cruised to victory.

278|||VIRGIN Atlantic is to scrap its Little Red domestic service next year, blaming its demise on a lack of business travellers and the “totally inadequate” number of runway slots offered up by regulators Virgin to ground domestic flights after two years VIRGIN Atlantic is to scrap its Little Red domestic service next year, blaming its demise on a lack of business travellers and the “totally inadequate” number of runway slots offered up by regulators.


The airline, which flies to Aberdeen and Edinburgh from Heathrow, also admitted that it had failed to draw in enough customers who were willing to connect with its parent group’s long-haul routes.
Little Red launched in March last year with services between London and Manchester, having acquired take-off and landing slots at Heathrow after the takeover of BMI by IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia. It introduced flights to Scotland the following month.
But Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said yesterday that the outfit had been unable to make a “positive contribution” to the group and it will stop flying to Manchester at the end of March, with Scottish services ceasing in September.
Kreeger said: “It was always a huge challenge on behalf of the consumer, as the totally inadequate number of slots made available by the European Commission did not deliver close to BA’s network position, even when supplemented by our own slots to fly between Heathrow and Manchester.
“The time lag between the takeover of BMI and our entering the market also meant Little Red faced an uphill battle to win recognition and convert customers to its services.”
The decision was described as “disappointing” by a spokeswoman for Aberdeen Airport, which itself has been put up for sale by owner Heathrow.
She added: “From what we understand, this decision has been taken as part of a wider review of operations, in which the services hadn’t performed as they were hoping.
“We will continue to work with the Virgin Atlantic team over the coming year to deliver to their passengers, and everyone using our airport.”
A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: “We will of course give Virgin Atlantic Little Red all the support we can during its last year. Edinburgh Airport’s success is built on giving our passengers choice and whilst we’re disappointed to be losing this service, we know that an opportunity still remains. We’re sure that others will be interested in exploring this with us.”
Figures published in April showed that Virgin Atlantic, in which US carrier Delta has a 49 per cent stake, narrowed its pre-tax losses to &pound;51 million in 2013, from &pound;102m the previous year, and Kreeger said the airline was on track to deliver a profit by the end of this year.
Sir Richard Branson, who owns 51 per cent of the airline he founded in 1984, said: “When the competition authorities allowed British Airways to take over BMI and all of its slots, we feared there was little we could do to challenge BA’s huge domestic and European network built through decades of dominance.
“To remedy this, we were offered a meagre package of slots on a short-term basis and decided to lease a couple of planes and give it our best shot. The odds were stacked against us and sadly we just couldn’t attract enough corporate business on these routes.”
Virgin Atlantic insisted that it was committed to its operations in Scotland, with extra flights to be added to its route between Glasgow and Orlando in the summer. It is also introducing a service from Glasgow to Las Vegas next year.

279|||A PRISON has made good progress in responding to recommendations from an inspection three years ago, according to a new report Report praises HMP Kilmarnock’s ‘good progress’ A PRISON has made good progress in responding to recommendations from an inspection three years ago, according to a new report.

Inspectors made 10 recommendations when they visited HMP Kilmarnock in October 2011.
At a follow-up inspection this July they found that seven of these had been achieved and two partially achieved while one is no longer applicable.
However, they have now made an additional 11 recommendations.
These include that all prisoners should have access to one hour in the open air every day and that the time they spend in reception when they are admitted should be reduced.
David Strang, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: “It is clear from our inspection that good progress has been made by HMP Kilmarnock in the areas identified in the full inspection report.”
He added: “A new director of HMP Kilmarnock had been appointed in the three months before the follow-up inspection, following the retirement of his predecessor.
“It is still early days but he has brought a fresh perspective to the leadership of the prison.
“In general, we observed good relationships between staff and prisoners. Most prisoners reported to us that they felt safe in HMP Kilmarnock.”
The previous inspection report identified 40 action points, 25 of which have now been achieved, five partially achieved, seven have not been achieved and three are deemed no longer applicable.
The report noted that healthcare at the prison is provided to a good standard but that there remains a need to improve the medical facilities.
It said there is scope to improve communication and mutual understanding between the prison and NHS Ayrshire and Arran, and that the distribution of medication in the residential wings should be reviewed, particularly at the weekends.
Inspectors also found that a high number of prisoners are deemed medically unfit for work and that the processes associated with this should be reviewed.
One of the action points in the previous report was that prisoners should receive their full entitlement of one hour a day in the open air, but this did not always happen, with some receiving only 45 minutes.
The follow-up report recommended that all prisoners should receive an hour in the open air and that the prison should ensure that the process for supervising prisoners at outside exercise is safe at all times.
Inspectors found that all 16 areas of good practice identified in the previous report are still in place and highlighted an additional six.
They noted good examples of engagement with families, through family days and the “email a prisoner service” which encourages family members, especially children, to maintain contact with their relative in prison.
The report also found improvements in the delivery of education and vocational training, in terms of both quantity and quality of qualifications.
HMP Kilmarnock, which opened in 1999, is a high-security prison with 500 cells and a maximum contract capacity of 692.
At the time of inspection 501 prisoners were being held, compared to 647 at the time of the full inspection.
It is operated by SERCO under a 25-year contract issued by Scottish ministers to Kilmarnock Prison Service Limited.###
280|||BILLY Connolly said he will not let illness keep him off the stage as he enjoys the best reception of his career on his latest stand-up tour Billy Connolly relishing return to stage BILLY Connolly said he will not let illness keep him off the stage as he enjoys the best reception of his career on his latest stand-up tour.


The comedian and actor is currently starring alongside David Tennant and Rosamund Pike in the film What We Did On Our Holiday and is the latest star to trace his family roots in BBC One’s Who Do You Think You Are, screened last week.
He has also embarked on a sell-out tour of Scotland despite being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease last year and receiving treatment for prostate cancer.
New York-based Connolly is currently in Edinburgh, where he is performing several nights to an audience of 2,200 at the Usher Hall.
He admitted it was “a bit scary” going back on stage but said: “It’s quite nice though, because since I got sick, I thought I might not go back on the road. But after about four weeks I thought, ‘b****r this, I’m going out there’.
“It’s good, it’s a nice feeling.
“After about three weeks you start to get itchy again. You can only go fishing so much, and go for walks and read and watch television.
“You miss what you do for a living. It’s your job, it’s your function, so you just get out there and do it. It’s dead simple really.
“I’ve got the best reception I’ve ever had.”
He said of his health: “I’m okay. I’ve got Parkinson’s disease, which doesn’t really get better, but the cancer thing has gone, so I’m alright about that. I’m pretty cool about the whole thing.”
The Celtic fan spoke after assisting the draw for the William Hill Scottish Cup third round on stage at the Usher Hall. 
He said it was great to see the trophy, which he described as an “old pal” after holding it as a 12-year-old when it was brought to his school in 1959.
The comic said his fondest Scottish Cup memory was a semi-final between Celtic and Kilmarnock “where a goalkeeper called Brown dived the wrong way and back-heeled it over the bar”.
Connolly, whose team endured a defeat by Hamilton Academical at the weekend, said the Scottish Cup was good for smaller clubs.
He said: “It’s good for team football because they can’t afford superstars, so they are going to have to play like a team and, as the Hamilton Accies proved, if you play like a team you can win, you can beat anybody. I’m a great believer in that.”

281|||THE Liberal Democrats could opt out of coalition with either of the larger parties if next year’s general election is inconclusive, party president Tim Farron has said Liberal Democrats prepared to sit out coalition THE Liberal Democrats could opt out of coalition with either of the larger parties if next year’s general election is inconclusive, party president Tim Farron has said.

Negotiators in any coalition talks must make clear they are ready to “walk away” if the party cannot secure its red-line priorities, Mr Farron told a meeting on the fringe of the Lib Dem conference.
Unlike 2010, when the financial crisis made it imperative for Britain to have a stable majority government, the Liberal Democrats will be in a position after the 2015 poll of being able to sit back and allow Labour or Tories to attempt to govern as a minority administration, he suggested.
The Westmorland and Lonsdale MP is often tipped as a possible replacement for Nick Clegg, but he was staunch in his support for the leader, who he said had been an “outstanding” Deputy Prime Minister. And he condemned any Lib Dems positioning themselves for a post-election succession.

Lib Dem conference: Cable slams Tory tax cut plan

“Anybody who is giving headspace to there being anyone other than Nick as leader is letting the side down massively,” said Mr Farron. Describing next May’s election as “the toughest we have faced since 1992”, he said: “If you are wasting effort on thinking about what happens to yourself in seven or eight months’ time, then shame on you.”
Left-leaning Mr Farron is often viewed as more comfortable with the prospect of coalition with Labour than a repeat of the Tory/Lib Dem government of the past four years.
But he insisted that the third party will not be in a position to choose between potential partners, as parliamentary arithmetic is likely to dictate that only one coalition option will deliver a viable majority government.

• As the dust settles on Scotland’s historic referendum, The Scotsman has created a special digital supplement to document the twists and turns of this hard-fought campaign.

Asked at the meeting hosted by The Times whether a hung parliament would present Lib Dems with a difficult choice between Labour and Tories, Mr Farron replied: “It only puts us in a difficult position if the utterly random and almost impossible circumstances turn out where our numbers could make a majority with either party.
“That will not happen. It’s probably about a million-to-one chance of that happening.
“We will either, in a balanced Parliament, have the option of going into coalition with one of the two parties or sitting back. That will be the only choice we have - it will not be a case of do we prefer Labour or Tories.”

Coalition preference

Mr Farron said his preference was for a coalition producing a stable majority administration, but said that Lib Dem negotiators must not be so focused on that goal that the other parties feel they can “take us for granted”.
“You don’t go into coalition negotiations letting your potential partners think that you are absolutely going to roll over and have your tummy tickled and go into coalition whatever the outcome of those negotiations,” said Mr Farron.

Lib Dem conference: UK needs ‘Lib Dem influence’


“You have to in your own heart and mind - and in their hearts and minds - make it absolutely clear that you can and will, if it comes down to it, walk away. If you don’t do that you are going to get nothing out of any coalition negotiations.
“With what I hope will be an absence of the financial crisis of 2010, the absolute burning necessity to have a majority government in 2015 will be a little less than it was in 2010.
“A minority administration - which is not my preference - is not the horror story that it would have been four and a half years ago.”
Mr Farron declined to name the “red line” issues on which negotiators should refuse to budge.
But asked if opposition to an in/out referendum on EU membership should be a red line, he said: “It’s important that we don’t give away a referendum lightly, if at all.”
It might be easier for pro-Europeans to win a referendum under a Tory-led administration than one led by Labour, as Conservatives in opposition would give free rein to their Eurosceptic instincts, he suggested.

Mike Russell: I made mistakes in new exams this year...but I won't say sorry The Education Secretary has admitted that mistakes were made in introducing new exams in schools but has refused to apologise to teachers, parents and pupils.Michael Russell said the process of implementing new qualifications under the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) had been &quot;difficult&quot; but insisted that the new system &quot;is succeeding and will succeed&quot;.He told Holyrood's Education Committee that the national qualifications, which replaced standard grades, had undoubtedly created over-assessment in schools but said this would decrease over the next year.Mr Russell said: &quot;Everybody who is involved in this process has made mistakes. Everybody can think of things they would want to do differently.&quot;This can be difficult and has been difficult, it has not been perfect, no work of human hand is perfect.&quot;But I think that there has been genuine good work undertaken across the board, by this committee right through to schools, to individuals, and that has produced results and that's what we intend to go on doing.&quot;The Education Secretary faced calls to apologise to teachers, parents and pupils who had struggled with the changes.Labour MSP Neil Bibby said: &quot;You have accepted there have been mistakes made in the course of this. You have said that there has been over-assessment.&quot;As the man who is ultimately responsible, would you like to apologise to the teachers, parents and pupils for what has gone on?&quot;Mr Russell responded: &quot;No, what I'd like to do is to pay tribute to everybody who has worked so hard.&quot;Everybody has worked hard on this and it has been tough for a lot of different people.&quot;But in those circumstances we have done something that is worthwhile and is producing results for the young people of Scotland.&quot;CfE is a good thing which many, many people have worked together to make a success and I'm grateful to every single one of them.&quot;He added: &quot;We have in process a culture change that is and has been difficult for some teachers, but the whole programme is designed to support that change and to make it happen.&quot;Mr Russell insisted that the extra workload faced by teachers was &quot;absolutely not integral&quot; to the new exam system.He said: &quot;There's no doubt there was over-assessment.&quot;I will want to be assured that the assessment pressures do not increase and indeed they decrease over the next 12 months and at each examination diet thereafter.&quot;If we trust teachers to teach then there should be a reduction, particularly in the unnecessary bureaucracy in the system.&quot;###

Scottish Government fund to treat rare conditions doubles to £40m A Scottish Government fund to pay for new drugs to treat rare conditions is to double to £40 million, the Health Secretary said today.The New Medicines Fund will replace and expand the Rare Conditions Medicines Fund set up in March last year, giving health boards access to greater resources to fund the cost of new medicines, Alex Neil said.In 2013/14 the Rare Conditions Medicines Fund supported the cost of 45 different medicines for more than 200 patients with conditions including cystic fibrosis and Hodgkin's Lymphoma.The new fund is being established with the rebate to the Scottish Government made by the pharmaceutical industry under the UK-wide branded drug pricing scheme the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme.It also follows changes to the way drugs are assessed by the Scottish Medicines Consortium.Mr Neil said: &quot;Parliament has considered the issue of access to new medicines very carefully in the last 18 months and there was a clear consensus that steps should be taken to improve access to new medicines for rare conditions and for people who have terminal conditions.&quot;That's why I tasked the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) to develop new ways to ensure the voices of patients and clinicians were better heard in the new medicines approval process, and to ensure that access was improved to medicines for rare and end-of-life conditions.&quot;The SMC have now started to implement these changes and we will be closely monitoring them to determine if any further action is needed in the future.&quot;The dedicated &pound;40 million New Medicines Fund will complement these changes and will help ensure that more patients get access to the latest medicines as quickly as possible.&quot;Alastair Kent, of Genetic Alliance UK, a charity which helps patients affected by genetic conditions, said: &quot;Advances in research are creating new hope for patients with incurable rare diseases.&quot;Without funding, this hope will be frustrated, as those in need will not be able to benefit from the therapies produced, and patients will continue to suffer when something might have been done.&quot;We hope that the rules for accessing this new funding will be simple, widely disseminated and speedy in their operation.&quot;###

Pipes advice as weather turns cold Scottish Water is urging householders to protect their homes as the cold weather begins to bite.Winter temperatures can lead to frozen and burst pipes in properties that are not adequately insulated, the company warned.People can also reduce their energy bills this winter by using less water, with Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change figures showing that 18% of domestic energy is used for heating water.Scottish Water issued the advice in the latest phase of an awareness campaign to reduce the 40,000 drain and sewer blockages it dealt with last year at a cost of &pound;7 million.Cooking fat, nappies, cotton buds and wipes were the main offenders after being put down sinks and toilets.They combine to produce a mass of solidified fat and material which can clog up pipes and lead to the flooding of homes and gardens and pollution of rivers and burns.Spokesman Chris Wallace said: &quot;A new addition to this phase is our advert to encourage everyone to get prepared and follow our winter code to heat and insulate their home or business now to help protect against frozen or burst pipes in colder, winter weather.&quot;Last winter was mild with very little in the way of extreme temperatures, snow and ice, and after a quiet and warm summer, it would be a mistake for us to be lulled into thinking we may be in line for another mild winter.&quot;Over the last five years the winter season has been very volatile, going between very cold and very mild conditions, and it is important we take these sensible and simple actions to protect our homes and businesses against the elements.&quot;Information for householders on how to prepare their property for winter is available at www.scottishwater.co.uk/winter###

Number of shotguns at a record high The number of shotguns, firearms dealers and items held on firearms certificates in Scotland have reached record highs, official figures show.There were 142,142 shotguns held in Scotland at the end of March, 219 more than last year and a 10% increase in the last decade.The number of firearms dealers has increased by almost a third in the last decade to 358, with an increase of eight in the last year.The number of items held on firearms certificates has increased by 44% in the last decade to 91,863, up 7,505 in the last year to a record high.These include 44,267 rifles, 87 under lever and 13 bolt action carbine weapons, 195 muzzleloader rifles and 482 muzzleloader handguns, 251 air rifles and 107 air handguns.There were also 805 handguns including single shot humane killers, used in animal slaughter, shot pistols and trophies of war.The rise in items held on firearms certificates has been described as &quot;artificial&quot; by Scotland's chief statistician due to the universal inclusion of &quot;sound moderators&quot;, also known as silencers, in firearm certificate statistics.Silencers are subject to certification but only Strathclyde and Fife legacy forces included them in their certificate figures, but the move to the single police force has led to standardised recording in all regions.The vast majority (7,100) of the increase can be attributed to the number of miscellaneous items in the legacy areas that have included sound moderators for the first time, the statistician said.There were 26,101 firearm certificates on issue at the end of March 2014, a slight increase from the end of 2013 but lower than the figure in 2005, meaning there are now more guns concentrated in fewer hands.###

Michael McCann, 50, allegedly confronted a 17-year-old boy and his friend as the pair campaigned for Yes Scotland in his East Kilbride constituency.
It is believed that the schoolboy’s father made a complaint to the police after the incident.
Mr McCann, who said he was “absolutely delighted” with the result of the referendum last month, is said to have made counter allegations against his accusers.
Mr McCann is the chairman of the group of Scottish Labour MPs at Westminster.
A police spokesman said a 50-year-old man had been reported to the Procurator Fiscal.###
297|||A SECURITY guard who tried to stop armed robbers in a Glasgow shopping centre has had his wages withheld after being signed off from work for a fortnight by his doctor Argyll Arcade heist security guard gets pay docked A SECURITY guard who tried to stop armed robbers in a Glasgow shopping centre has had his wages withheld after being signed off from work for a fortnight by his doctor.

Employers GMB have agreed to cover George Ferrier’s statutory sick pay - but not his wages. Mr Ferrier, 56, was set upon by thieves carrying baseball bats and axes as he tried to prevent their escape from the upmarket retail district off Buchanan Street on September 14.
The security guard sustained multiple injuries to his legs from being struck by a baseball bat as he guided staff to safety. Mr Ferrier was forced to eventually let the robbers pass after they ran at him with axes. 
Mr Ferrier told the Daily Record that he was “disappointed” with the way his employers had treated him, accusing them of not caring about his health and well-being after the attack. 
After being told to rest for two weeks by his doctor, Mr Ferrier discovered that GMB would only pay him &pound;87.55 a week - a sum only paid out once an employee has been off for four days in a row. 
He said: “I’ve had a lot of really nice feedback but the work has been keen to get me back as quickly as possible. If they think I should be getting just sick pay after what’s happened, that’s up to them - but it doesn’t seem right to me. I’m disappointed in them.”

299|||IT is claimed Jonathan Kelly, 33, wants to emulate one-eyed killer Cregan, who is serving life for murdering constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicole Hughes, 23, and two gangland rivals. Fugitive machete thug threatens to emulate killer Dale Cregan by shooting police officer - Daily Record A VIOLENT fugitive has styled himself on police killer Dale Cregan and is threatening to shoot officers.
Jonathan Kelly is armed and prepared to kill if police close in on him.
A friend said: “He’s got a shotgun and if the police get him, he’s going to take one of them out. He’s planning to kill an officer.
“He’s a dangerous man who needs to be caught.”
Kelly, who paralysed a man with a machete, went on the run last month after breaching bail conditions.
He has a string of convictions for violence and is listed as one of the UK’s most wanted criminals on a Crimestoppers hitlist.
The source said Kelly, 33, cut off his electronic tag before going into hiding.
It is claimed the thug wants to emulate one-eyed Cregan, 31, who is serving life for murdering constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, and two gangland rivals.
The source added: “Kelly’s getting help to hide from police.
“He used my phone to contact one of Edinburgh’s best-known gangsters.
“It was just before he ran away and he was asking for money.
“He planned the whole thing and he’s not going to give himself up.
“He’s comparing himself to Dale Cregan.
“He said to me, ‘I’m not going back to jail for something stupid’.”
 

Kelly, of Drumchapel, Glasgow, has boasted about the machete horror and about attacking gay people.
He has also bragged about a catalogue of violent offences in prison .
He went on the run after he was made the subject of 32 strict conditions following his release from Low Moss prison in Lanarkshire.
A team of dedicated officers have been trying to flush him out but he keeps giving them the slip.
Last month, armed officers swooped on a block of flats on Glasgow’s south side after being tipped off that Kelly was inside .
But the hardened criminal managed to get away.
Detectives are quizzing Kelly’s former prison associates in a bid to track him down.
The Daily Record revealed that while Kelly was in prison, he wrote to campaign group Miscarriages of Justice UK to brag about his life of violence.
In the letter, Kelly said he was initially locked up for the machete attack .
He boasted in the letter: “While on remand in Barlinnie, I told screws not to put another con in my cell or I would be forced to hurt him.
“After a couple of hours, I repeatedly slashed and stabbed him. If it hadn’t been for night staff, he would have died.”
Kelly got five years for that assault and was moved to
Kilmarnock jail, where he says he “lasted only three or four months before assaulting two prisoners”.
He claimed he then began attacking officers because they were playing “mind games” with him.
Kelly said he attacked three warders in three days and was moved to Perth, where he staged a dirty protest and assaulted officers “at any opportunity I got”.
He said he has also attacked staff at Shotts, Glenochil, Edinburgh, Barlinnie and Addiewell jails and bragged: “Seven High Court trials, but only three convictions.”
Detective Inspector Ian Hylands, from Drumchapel police station, said: “Significant police inquiries are ongoing to trace Mr Kelly.
“However, there have been no positive sightings.
“Unfortunately, we have had very little information from the public regarding his whereabouts.
“Although we do not consider him to be a danger to the public, we do believe that he may pose a risk.
“We would advise the public not to approach Mr Kelly but to contact police immediately via 999.
“It is imperative that the public get in touch with any information they think may lead us to where he is.”
At Preston Crown Court in June last year, Cregan, 31, was ordered to serve a whole life sentence.
He killed the PCs near Manchester in September 2012 after making a hoax emergency call to police.###
300|||MSP Jackie Bailliie hits out after Scottish Government reveal new hospital figures Cancer targets missed in Dumbarton, the Vale of Leven and Helensburgh - Daily Record New figures reveal crucial targets for cancer patients have been missed again in Dumbarton, the Vale and Helensburgh and Lomond.
Newly published Scottish Government figures show that NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde failed to meet targets designed to cut treatment waiting times for cancer patients.
In the three months until June this year, 91.6 percent of patients in NHS Highland and 90.7 percent in NHS Glasgow Greater Glasgow and Clyde received cancer treatment within the first two months of referral.
This is despite a Scottish Government-set target to start treatment in at least 95 percent of cases within 62 days.
Nine out of the 14 health boards in Scotland missed the target, including the two health boards which serve Dumbarton, Vale of Leven and Helensburgh and Lomond.
Dumbarton MSP Jackie said: “It is disappointing that once again these vital targets are not being met. Finding out you have cancer is hard enough so it is unacceptable that one in 10 people are having to wait over two months for treatment to start.
“These targets were supposed to guarantee cancer patients no more than a 62 day wait between referral and treatment. But the figures show that waiting times have actually increased compared to the same period last year and some people are forced to wait over six months for treatment in the worst cases. The SNP’s failure to take decisive action is letting down patients in Dumbarton, the Vale of Leven and Helensburgh and Lomond.”###
301|||Twenty-eight bands and more than 800 Loyalist men and women are making the procession through residential areas of Johnstone on Saturday, sparking major concerns. Families worried about controversial Orange Walk planned to go through Renfrewshire town - Daily Record OUTRAGED householders have condemned plans for a massive Orange Walk amid fears of sectarian tension in the town.
Twenty-eight bands and more than 800 Loyalist men and women are making the procession through residential areas of Johnstone on Saturday, sparking major concerns.
The bandsmen and women will parade through the private Howwood Road estate en route to the town’s High Street.
Families fear there is a potential for disturbances following recent violent scenes involving a Loyalist mob at George Square in Glasgow.
However, Orange marchers from Johnstone band &quot;Sons of the Somme&quot; want to commemorate the sacrifice and memory of their countrymen to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One.
The Orange Order has sought permission to mark Saturday’s event with a procession ending with a solemn wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph.
One mum, who has complained to her councillor over the march, said she fears for the safety of youngsters in the area.
She said: “This march is causing fear in the community because it comes right by our doorsteps where children play. They are being allowed to parade through privately-owned areas in the town.
“The march is not sticking to main roads, so householders are rightly upset about 1,000 people stamping down the road at 5pm on a Saturday.
“None of the residents were written to, or leafleted, about this in advance.”
Another householder also voiced her fears about march followers swarming into the area.
She said: “Bands from other areas, including Northern Ireland are coming over.
“The procession also attracts supporters who tag along beside it singing and shouting while waving their flags.
“I don’t think the people of Johnstone were properly consulted in advance about this march and the events in George Square in Glasgow are still fresh in many people’s minds.”
The march is timed to begin at 4.30pm when bandsmen muster at the McMaster Centre then head through Greenend Avenue to Cochranemill Road, down Huntersfield Road and Arran Drive to Longmeadow.
From there, the procession enters Kilbarchan Road, Graham Street, McDowall Street and the High Street where the wreath-laying ceremony is taking place at the Cenotaph.
Councillor Iain McMillan, Labour member for Johnstone South, Elderslie and Howwood, said he has received complaints over the procession.
He said: “Residents have expressed their concerns to me about the march because this is a large procession. It also takes an unusual route via people’s houses.
“However, the procession route has been altered already after submissions and I am informed there will be plenty of stewards and police in attendance to properly ensure the event passes off without problems. “
Police Scotland also confirmed they have had complaints regarding the march, but are confident it will be policed “professionally and proportionally.”
Inspector Gerry McBride told the Paisley Daily Express: “We are aware of complaints regarding the march on October 11.
“However, I would like reassure members of the public that it will be policed properly – professionally and proportionally – with resources to match the event.”
“Police Scotland have been working with our partners at Renfrewshire Council in preparation for the practical organisation of policing the event and have plans in place to address any concerns.”
A spokesman for Renfrewshire Council said: “We understand a change to the timing of this procession and the route were suggested during the consultation processes. Each amendment was posted on the website to give people an opportunity to comment.
“The Greenend Avenue part of the proposed route however was listed in the original, and revised, applications.
“The council has not suggested any re-routing of the proposed procession.
“We haven’t received any formal objections to the original application or the amended versions from members of the public.”###
302|||THE iconic A-listed building in Glasgow city centre suffered severe damage in May's blaze but today took another step on its way to restoration. Video: Fire ravaged Glasgow School of Art gets a new waterproof roof for winter - Daily Record 
A MASSIVE operation to fit a temporary roof to fire-ravaged Glasgow School of Art was in full swing yesterday.
Work to make the Mackintosh masterpiece watertight before winter should be completed by this weekend.
Contractors are placing a specially designed aluminium frame on top of the historic building, which was badly damaged by a blaze in May. The temporary structure will then be covered in waterproof material.
A huge crane was used yesterday to painstakingly position each of the 1.5-ton roof sections, which had been assembled on the ground by 10 men.
John Watson, development manager at principal contractors SGB Roofing, said: “In the 30-odd years I’ve been in the scaffolding business, this is the most unique building I’ve worked on.
“The roof is a bespoke design for a bespoke building.”
The temporary roof is the first major step in the restoration project, which is expected to last up to three years and estimated to cost &pound;20million to &pound;30million.

Douglas Anderson, who studied architecture at Glasgow School of Art and went to the same school – Allan Glen’s Institution – as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, is overseeing the bid to restore the landmark to its former glory.
The project manager said: “It’s been drummed into me how important Mackintosh was, and that has followed me throughout my career.
“The building has been stabilised, and now this roof will protect it from the weather and allow us to get power back into it.
“The whole top floor is open to the elements, so we have been lucky with the good summer – but the bad weather is closing in.
“Once the roof is on, we’ll be able to determine exactly what the job ahead is.”
Students studying fine art, painting and printmaking have been temporarily decanted to the Tontine Building in Glasgow’s Merchant City.
Meanwhile, some of those who lost all their work when the School of Art went up in flames have produced their first exhibition.

Fine art graduate Adam Quinn is leading a band of seven, dubbed The Fanfare Group, who are holding a show at the city’s Veneer Gallery.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow’s Baillieston said: “When you join art school, the thing you are working towards for four years is the degree show, and you are looking forward to it the whole time.
“I lost practically my whole final year’s work in the fire. It was absolutely devastating.
“We can’t even make plans for the future as the fire has left us unable to move on with our lives because we don’t have much work to show for all our efforts.”
Veneer owner Alex Campbell said: “The Fanfare Group have shown amazing spirit to quite literally rise from the ashes.
“This show is a true display of their skill, courage and commitment.”
● A HERITAGE Lottery Fund grant of almost &pound;10million has been awarded for the redevelopment of Aberdeen Art Gallery, Cowdray Hall and Memorial Court.
The &pound;30million project secured planning permission and listed building consent last autumn and Aberdeen City Council have also committed &pound;10million towards the cost.

Dutch firm to run Scotrail trains FirstGroup has lost out on the franchise to run most of Scotland's trains for the next decade.Transport Scotland instead intends to hand the ScotRail franchise to rail operator Abellio, the offshoot of Dutch national railways said.FirstGroup, which was among five bidders to run the service from April 2015, said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the news, and that its bid would have delivered &quot;even greater levels of service and growth&quot;.Tim O'Toole, FirstGroup's chief executive, said: &quot;Our bid would have delivered even greater levels of service and growth, and we are disappointed we will not have the opportunity to implement the credible plans we submitted, building on our record of improvement across every measurable score, for the benefit of ScotRail's passengers and employees.&quot;We shall continue to operate First ScotRail until the new franchise commences on April 1, 2015.&quot;Mr O'Toole said that today's news does not alter the Group's stated medium-term targets.He said: &quot;As one of the largest and most experienced rail operators we are actively participating in franchise competitions with the objective of achieving earnings on a par with the last round of franchising, with an acceptable level of risk.&quot;Union bosses had reacted angrily to reports Abellio was to be handed the contract.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: &quot;It is scandalous that just a few weeks after the referendum, and promises from all quarters that the Scottish people would have an increased say in every aspect of their lives, that the continued privatisation of Scotland's railways has been bulldozed through with the SNP colluding with the political elite in Westminster to deny the opportunity for this franchise to be brought back into public ownership.&quot;There is no question that this whole franchising process could and should have been halted, pending the ratification of the post referendum devolution settlement, instead of rushing headlong into a deal that will deny the Scottish people ownership and control of their railways for many years to come.&quot;Patrick Harvie, Green Party MSP for Glasgow and transport spokesman for the Scottish Greens, called on ministers to give an assurance over the new ScotRail franchise.He said: &quot;It would be ironic to have a Dutch national railway company taking over most of Scotland's trains. While it would be great to see public transport run by a public sector firm it should be our public sector.&quot;There's huge public appetite for bringing rail back into public hands. We need an assurance from the Transport Minister that the optional five year break in the ScotRail franchise will allow for a Scottish public sector operator to bid, assuming power is devolved from Westminster to allow it.&quot;The Dutch firm said: &quot;Abellio is pleased to announce that Transport Scotland has confirmed its intention to award the ScotRail franchise to Abellio ScotRail Limited. Although we are not listed, an announcement will be made to this effect to the London Stock Exchange in due course.&quot;###
304|||Billionaire Mike Ashley has called for an extraordinary general meeting to force a shake-up of Rangers' board. Ashley calls EGM in bid to shake up Rangers board Billionaire Mike Ashley has called for an extraordinary general meeting to force a shake-up of Rangers' board.The Sports Direct tycoon, who may now hold the key to the power battle at the Ibrox club, has called for the removal of chief executive Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors.A statement on the London Stock Exchange read: &quot;Mash (Ashley's personal investment company) requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company.&quot;The notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of the company.&quot;The company is currently verifying that the Notice is properly constituted.&quot;If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company's forthcoming Annual General Meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course.&quot;The Board is united in its support of the executive team.&quot;If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.&quot;Newcastle United owner Ashley strengthened his power base at Rangers last week.However, fans' groups have strongly criticised the Newcastle United owner for paying 20p a share through two intermediaries for the purchase, rather than spend the same amount on the recent open offer aimed at raising &pound;3.6million.It was confirmed last week that he bought 4.26m in shares from Rangers International Football Club plc, more than doubling his stake.Ashley's influence over matters at the club have long concerned the Ibrox faithful.Already worried by the way he has antagonised Newcastle supporters, their fears only increased when it was revealed last month that he had bought naming rights to Ibrox from former chief executive Charles Green for just &pound;1.He has already struck a deal to take over the club's retail division and his latest move appears to be his next bid for increased power at board room level.Reports have recently suggested that club board chairman Sandy Easdale favours Ashley as the man to solve the club's deepening financial troubles, while Wallace would prefer to see former oldco director Dave King return to the club as a new investor.If Ashley's bid to oust Wallace and Nash is to be successful, however, he will have to carry the backing of the majority of the club's stakeholders.Easdale's spokesman Jack Irvine said: &quot;Sandy Easdale is not part of the PLC board and has no knowledge of any of the recent announcements. However he is watching with interest.&quot;###

Dying father went into chip shop for help after stabbing A stabbing victim staggered into a chip shop and asked for a glass of water.New dad Stephen McGinlay, 26, was left covered in blood after being attacked by three thugs in a Glasgow street.He staggered along St George's Road, in Woodside, moments after the attack.As reported in late editions of yesterday's Evening Times, Stephen, who was set upon at around 5.50pm on Thursday, died in hospital on Sunday.Detective Chief Inspector Bob Frew, who is leading the murder hunt, said: &quot;This was a targeted attack and the victim may have known his attackers.&quot;Some members of the public may have seen the incident and not realised the severity of the situation.&quot;It may have looked like a minor scuffle. I am sure there are witnesses who have not yet come forward.&quot;Stephen staggered into the nearby chip shop, where his friend was, to get help.&quot;He is believed to have asked staff at the Prego Fish Bar for a glass of water before collapsing.Mr Frew said Stepehen's killers arrived and left by car.Tributes, including flowers and football tops, have been left on railings, near to where the attack took place.Detectives were today trying to establish a motive for the killing and piece together Mr McGinlay's last movements.Locals fear the killing could lead to &quot;tit-for-tat&quot; attacks.One said: &quot;We don't want to see more flowers and football tops left in the street for another young guy.&quot;A spokesman for Prego's declined to comment, confirming only that shop staff had tried to help Stephen.Anyone with information should call police in Govan on 101.rebecca.gray@ eveningtimes.co.uk###
306|||POLICE Scotland could call in Interpol to help track down the armed robbers behind a £250,000 designer watch heist. Interpol could help track down watch heist gang POLICE Scotland could call in Interpol to help track down the armed robbers behind a £250,000 designer watch heist.Detectives fear the stolen timepieces may already be bound for another country.The raiders took just 54 seconds to smash open window display cases in Glasgow's Argyll Arcade and escape with the haul of top-of-the-range watches.As revealed by the Evening Times, police said it was unlikely the items would be sold in the UK, as no reputable trader would touch them.Four balaclava-clad men, armed with sledgehammers and axes, targeted Glasgow's jewellery district in Buchanan Street last week.Officers from the international police agency can be brought in to help the hunt.A police source said: &quot;Officers can call in Interpol, if and when they need to.&quot;Interpol, the world's largest police organisation, has a dedicated operation -the Pink Panther Project -which aims to identify, locate and apprehend jewellery thieves.Bosses at the international police agency believe the Pink Panthers group is behind armed robberies targeting high-end jewellery stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and America.The &quot;loosely-aligned&quot; network of criminals is believed to have carried out robberies worth in excess of 330 million Euros since 1999.Hundreds of suspects are linked to more than 340 robberies in 35 countries across the world.There is nothing to suggest the recent raid at the Argyll Arcade is linked to the gang.It is thought the gang could have spent hours &quot;staking out&quot; Glasgow's historic jewellery mall before last Wednesday's raid.Police believe they made their escape in a white VW Golf car, which was later found abandoned in a car park in Townhead, near Glasgow Royal Infirmary.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland said: &quot;We will be examining all potential avenues for selling high-value watches.&quot;In this case, it is more likely the watches would be sold abroad, possibly over the internet.&quot;But the gang - who remain at large - will struggle to sell on the high-end timepieces in Scotland, or even the UK.It is understood that, unless they were stolen to order, the thieves will have trouble offloading them any time soon.The armed thugs targeted Rox, Mappin and Webb, Laing the Jeweller and Lewis Grant.Rox was the only store to have items, including Hublot and Bell &amp; Ross watches, stolen.Anyone with any information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.rebecca.gray@eveningtimes.co.uk###
307|||MEASURING 6ft 10in at his shoulder blades Lincoln is thought to be the biggest horse in Europe. Meet Lincoln, thought to be Europe's biggest horse living in Cumbernauld MEASURING 6ft 10in at his shoulder blades Lincoln is thought to be the biggest horse in Europe.And in a couple of years he is almost certain to be the biggest horse in the world.From the tips of his ears to the soles of his feet the magnificent beast is close to 12ft tall.The massive, black Shire now lives a life of luxury at Tannoch Stables in Cumbernauld.But he faced being slaughtered and turned into pet food when he was rescued by two kind hearted animal lovers.Lincoln, whose official name is Ruskington Leicester, was bought by farmer Ruth Blair and company boss James Mackie and nursed back to health.Given his huge size it is hardly surprising the friendly horse has an appetite to match.But Lincoln turned out to have the ideal owners as Mr Mackie is managing director of wholesale fruit and vegetable company Fresh Direct.He said: &quot;I don't know how anyone else could &shy;afford to feed him.&quot;Each day, the horse munches his way through 26lb of carrots, 24 apples, 11lb of spinach, four or five cabbages plus occasional snacks from Mr Mackie's staff.Mr Mackie said: &quot;Lincoln had been very badly treated, was very emaciated and was going to end up in the meat trade.&quot;When he came to us I thought he was too far gone but he got vitamin injections and got a spark back in his eyes.&quot;Lincoln is the biggest horse in Europe and when I put him into the stable he hit his head off the roof.&quot;He still has a bit of growing to do but already you can't see over his back if you are standing next to him. Sitting on his back would be like sitting on top of a Transit van.&quot;He is a friendly big horse but so far has pulled down three fences and lifted the golf buggy I was in off the ground by picking up the back in his teeth.&quot;The biggest horse in the world is 11-year-old Jake who lives in America and is three quarters of an inch taller than Lincoln.Jake is fully grown but Lincoln will continue to grow for the next two years.Ms Blair agreed Lincoln doesn't know his own strength.She said: &quot;He is a fabulous big horse with a kind, docile nature but has a tremendous amount of power in him. He now has a lifetime home.&quot;vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

309|||ASBESTOS campaigners have reacted with anger at court changes they feel downgrades their compensation claims. Asbestos victims react with fury to court claim changes ASBESTOS campaigners have reacted with anger at court changes they feel downgrades their compensation claims.The Court Reform Bill, passed at Holyrood, will move personal injury claims from the highest court, the Court of Session, to a Sheriff Court or new Personal Injury Court.Campaigners and people suffering from asbestos-related illnesses said they feel betrayed, with some calling on the Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill, to resign.A group of more than two dozen from Clydeside Action on Asbestos walked out of the Scottish Parliament in disgust as MSPs rejected an amendment that would have guaranteed their cases would be heard in the Court of Session.They feel insurance companies are the winners and some fear the legal costs associated with claims could wipe out any compensation they are awarded.Phyllis Craig, chairwoman of Clydeside Action on Asbestos, said: &quot;It is appalling what has happened. People are so angry. This means the insurers win but the people with the asbestosis lose.&quot;We wanted a guarantee that all asbestos cases remain in the Court of Session.&quot;Kenny MacAskill met us. We were informed last week he would seek asbestosis cases to remain in the highest court.&quot;Mr MacAskill later rejected a Labour amendment to exempt asbestos cases from being heard in the sheriff court.He repeated comments by the Justice committee Convener, Christine Grahame, who, according to Mr MacAskill, said: &quot;If we take one group of people and say it's special, another will come along and say theirs is special too&quot;.Mr MacAskill said: &quot;I fully acknowledge asbestos can be complex cases&quot; and he said &quot;complex cases and any appeals will be heard at the Court of Session, but they would be for the courts to decide on an individual basis.&quot;Cases with claims under &pound;100,000 will be sent to the sheriff court.Asbestos victims were outraged following the vote.John Brown, from West Calder, who worked in Clydeside yards, said: &quot;The threshold will affect 90% of our claimants, who will be sent to the sheriff Court. It's ridiculous. MacAskill should resign.&quot;Ron Marsh, from Stonehaven, was exposed to asbestos when he worked in the Cowlairs industrial area of Glasgow decades ago.He said &quot;Being diagnosed with an asbestos-related illness is devastating. My message for our justice secretary is very simple.&quot;Mr MacAskill, please do not allow court reform to hand a gift to the insurance industry, who behave in a shameful way towards asbestos victims and their loved ones.&quot;Asbestos sufferers expect you and your Government to be on their side&quot;Gordon Walker, who has had his claim settled, said he feared for others.He said: &quot;All we are looking for is a level playing field. Kenny MacAskill has gone back on his word to us.&quot;When a case goes to the Court of Session, insurance firms have to pay advocate fees. Now deductions will come from damages and could leave people with northing.&quot;stewart.paterson@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

Intercity drug gang is jailed Members of an organised crime gang who were caught transporting drugs and money between two major Scots cities have been jailed.William Anderson, 26, Stephen Wilson, 41, Daniel Jebb, 64, and Robert Maxwell, 57, were caught by police probing links between hoodlums in Glasgow and Dundee.Detectives also arrested Leon Bruce, 40, and Jordan Mitchell, 24, during their intelligence-led probe.The High Court in Edinburgh heard how the six men were involved in a racket which saw Glasgow-based drug dealers supply their Tayside counterparts with thousands of pounds worth of heroin.The facts emerged following a hearing before judge Lord Boyd earlier this year.Anderson, of Arklay Street, Dundee; Wilson, of Step Row, Dundee; Jebb, of Balglass Avenue, Glasgow; Maxwell, of Formby Drive, Glasgow; Bruce, of Tullideph Road, Dundee; and Mitchell, of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty earlier this year to drugs supply and money laundering charges.Sentence had been deferred until yesterday in order for the court to obtain reports about their character.The offences took place between May and August 2013.Lord Boyd jailed Anderson for three years. Wilson was jailed for three years, three months and Jebb for two years and four months.Maxwell was jailed for five years and 219 days. The judge deferred sentence on Bruce - who was a minor player in the scam - for a year in order for him to be of good behaviour.Mitchell, another minor player in the racket, was handed a 240 hour community service sentence.Passing sentence, Lord Boyd told the six men: &quot;The supply of illegal drugs - particularly class A drugs - is an evil and vile trade.&quot;It blights communities and the lives of individuals, as you well know.&quot;###

312|||A BUST of former South African president Nelson Mandela will be unveiled at Glasgow City Chambers. Nelson Mandela bust to mark city's role in long walk to freedom A BUST of former South African president Nelson Mandela will be unveiled at Glasgow City Chambers.Tomorrow's event coincides with the anniversary of Mr Mandela's 1993 visit to the city, following its bold decision, 12 years earlier, to award him the Freedom of the City.Glasgow was the first city to grant the honour to Mr Mandela, who was a political prisoner until 1981 because of his anti-apartheid beliefs.In a bold move to send a message to the then apartheid regime, in 1986 the council renamed St George's Place as Nelson Mandela Place.This was highly significant, as the South African Consulate was based there.In October 1993, two years after his release from prison, Mr Mandela came to Glasgow, where he was described by the then council leader Jean McFadden as &quot;a symbol of the fight for equality and freedom across the world&quot;.The event famously saw Mr Mandela dancing on stage in George Square, to the delight of the crowd of 10,000 people who had come to see him.Lord Provost Sadie Docherty will unveil the new bronze to invited guests, including the South African High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Obed Mlaba and Mr Brian Filling Honorary Consul to South Africa.The sculpture, which is slightly larger than life, will serve as a permanent reminder of an iconic freedom fighter and Glasgow's role in opposing apartheid.Celebrated sculptor Deirdre Nicholls won the &pound;20,000 commission to create the bronze which will be displayed in the foyer of the Chambers. She is also due to attend the unveiling.A plaque commemorating the 30th anniversary of Glasgow awarding Mr Mandela the Freedom of the City is also in the foyer of the council headquarters.It was unveiled, in 2011, by Denis Goldberg, a fellow defendant at the now infamous Rivonia trial.The plaque is engraved with the words Mr Mandela spoke from the dock during his 1964 trial.It reads: &quot;I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.&quot;It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.&quot;Earlier this year a book signed by Nelson Mandela when he was a prisoner was on display in the city.The &quot;Robben Island Bible&quot; - a copy of the complete works of Shakespeare, disguised as a Bible, which the prisoners read - was on display at the Mitchell Library to mark Nelson Mandela International Day.vivienne.nicoll@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

The heat is Zilli on in Aldo's chef test YOU CAN almost taste the fear in the room.Ten fine chefs from all over Scotland, whittled down from hundreds of hopefuls, are waiting expectantly for Aldo Zilli to start cooking.In a side room, Aldo - most famous for his legendary London seafood restaurant Zilli Fish - says he knows how they feel.&quot;It is a competition, they are nervous,&quot; he smiles. &quot;I have been there. What I am looking for is confidence, skills and techniques, knowledge of the ingredients and most of all, enjoyment.&quot;He pauses. &quot;But be scared too. That's good.&quot;The morning session, at The Cook School in Kilmarnock, is one of two Aldo will be judging.In the afternoon he will head to Clydebank for the best pizza final, which also features several Glasgow names including Toni's Pizzeria, Italian Kitchen, Il Pavone and the Battlefield Rest.The winners of all categories will be announced at a glittering awards dinner, hosted by Des Clarke, on October 26 at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow.Warren Paul, CEO for the Scottish Italian Awards, says: &quot;We are delighted with the response to this year's awards and having Aldo on board shows how serious the competition is.&quot;Aldo takes his place in the kitchen and within what seems like seconds has whipped up fresh pasta, cooked it in red wine and added pancetta and a pecorino cheese mousse.There are helpful tips along the way (&quot;keep your rolling pin in the freezer overnight&quot;, for example) and a minor calamity when a helpful assistant puts an onion Aldo has dropped on the floor back on the chopping board. &quot;Never, ever, EVER, put food which has been on the floor back on the board,&quot; he says, with icy calm, swapping the board and sending a look in the assistant's direction which would wither fresh herbs.With tension mounting, the chefs taste the finished dish and then return to their own workstations to begin cooking. Aldo moves among them, chatting to them all about their own restaurants and experience.&quot;It's good to see women involved,&quot; he says afterwards, commenting on the two female chefs who have made it to the final 10 - Daniela Cocchia, from Osteria in North Berwick, and Claire Rinaldi, from Primo Piano in Dumfries.&quot;There is a great deal of talent in Scotland. I love the country, I have many Scottish friends.&quot;But I think the UK as a whole has not yet seen the variety of Italian cooking that exists.ITALIAN cooking is vast - there are wide regional variations and most exist because grandmother has passed down recipes to mamma, to child.&quot;In the next five years, I think we will see much more of this regional variety coming to Britain.&quot;As each chef completes the dish, he or she takes it through to Aldo for tasting.He gives little away, although at one point he admits he is &quot;a little disappointed no-one is talking my language&quot;.&quot;I don't mean Italian, I mean the language of food,&quot; he adds.&quot;But they seem nervous, so that could be it.&quot;There are a couple of hairy moments - Aldo discovers a piece of onion skin in one dish, and another chef has reduced the red wine so much it has almost disappeared - but generally, the chefs are confident they have done their best.&quot;It's difficult - you are nervous, you are not in your own kitchen - but it was okay,&quot; smiles Mariano Russo, owner of La Fiorentina. &quot;We are chefs, used to working under pressure.&quot;Chris Rouse, of Celino's, agrees.&quot;It's great to see other chefs like Aldo in action and to meet chefs from all over the country.&quot;He grins: &quot;I'm glad it's done, and I'm feeling pretty relaxed.&quot;I think it went well.&quot;ann.fotheringham@ eveningtimes.co.uk###

317|||Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has called for an extraordinary meeting of Rangers shareholders to remove chief executive Graham Wallace. Rangers: Mike Ashley bids to oust chief executive Graham Wallace  Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has called for an extraordinary meeting of Rangers shareholders to remove chief executive Graham Wallace. 
 Ashley, who increased his stake in Rangers International Football Club (RIFC) plc to 9% this month, also wants the removal of director Philip Nash. 
 The board is currently &quot;verifying that the notice is properly constituted&quot;. 
 It states that, should it come to a vote, it will recommend that shareholders reject the motion. 
 But, if the motion is valid, it will attempt to have the notice withdrawn &quot;in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company's forthcoming annual general meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course&quot;. 
 Rangers announced to the Stock Exchange that they had &quot;received a notice dated 7 October 2014 from Mike Ashley, a director of MASH Holdings Limited&quot;. 
 &quot;The notice states that MASH holds 4,265,000 ordinary shares of 1p each in the company, amounting to 5% of the voting rights of the company,&quot; added the statement. 
 &quot;MASH requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company. 
 &quot;The board is united in its support of the executive team. If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.&quot; 
 Rangers promise a further announcement &quot;shortly&quot;. 
 The Glasgow club, who sit second in the Scottish Championship table, held an open offer to existing shareholders in September, raising &pound;3.13m as they sought to plug a funding gap, including the repayment of loans to shareholders.  
 Isle of Man hedge fund Laxey Partners bought five million extra shares to strengthen its position as the largest shareholder (16.3%). 
 Meanwhile, bus tycoon Sandy Easdale bought 1.2 million shares to take his personal stake to 5.21%, which means that, together with voting rights, he controls 26.15% of the club's shares. 
 Ashley declined to buy shares in the open offer, which diluted his stake to 3.69%, but he subsequently bought 4.62 million shares, which was larger than the number he could have bought in the open offer, from investment manager Hargreave Hale, at 20p per share. 
 It means that the sports retail entrepreneur, who holds 4% of shares personally on top of the 5% through MASH, is now the second largest shareholder in RIFC behind Laxey. 
 Ashley, who recently insisted he will not be selling Newcastle until the end of next season at the earliest, is limited to holding no more than 10% in Rangers by an agreement with the Scottish FA. 
 Wallace, who was previously chief operating officer at Manchester City and is also former chief financial officer with IMG and MTV Europe, became Rangers chief executive in November after predecessor Craig Mather departed following supporter protests during a period of financial turmoil. 
 Several Rangers fans groups have protested this season about the present regime and have urged the removal of Easdale from the board. 
 Meanwhile, South Africa-based businessman Dave King has told BBC Scotland that a newspaper report suggesting that he and other former Rangers directors are involved in a takeover is untrue. 
 He also recently told the BBC that he had not been involved in discussions with anyone on the board. ###
318|||Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been confirmed as the buyer of 4.26m shares in Rangers International Football Club, more than doubling his stake. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley takes Rangers stake to almost 9%  Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has been confirmed as the buyer of 4.26m shares in Rangers International Football Club, more than doubling his stake. 
 The shares were sold by Hargreave Hale on Tuesday to French bank BNP Paribas, but an announcement to the Stock Exchange revealed that the transaction was completed on Ashley's behalf. 
 The &pound;850,000 purchase of shares means he now holds an 8.92% stake in RIFC. 
 But he is limited to no more than 10% by an agreement with the Scottish FA. 
 The governing body has a rule that no individual holds stakes in two clubs, but compromised, while applying limitations, when Ashley was brought into RIFC as a shareholder by previous chief executive Charles Green. 
&quot;There has been much talk of Mike Ashley selling Newcastle but he has said recently that he is going nowhere until the end of next season at the earliest. It does appear he is turning his attention further north, though. He is now the second largest shareholder with just under 9%. He already owns the naming rights to Ibrox and has the deal to sell the shirts. This is Ashley making his move to have influence at boardroom level.&quot;
 Ashley, who is now the second largest shareholder in RIFC behind Laxey Partners who hold 16%, declined to buy shares in the open offer made to existing shareholders last month. 
 His stake was then diluted to 3.69%, but the stake he bought from Hargreave Hale, at 20p per share, was larger than the number of shares he could have bought in the open offer. 
 The BBC has also learned that during negotiations to provide a loan to the club last month, which would have prevented the need to hold the open offer, Ashley sought control of Rangers' trademark rights. This was declined by the directors, although a company called Rangers Retail Rights Limited was incorporated on 9 September 2014, with Ashley among the three directors. 
 If Ashley had participated in the open offer, the club would have received around &pound;840,000, but instead he spent a little more than &pound;850,000 buying Hargreave Hale's shares. The Rangers board are currently trying to raise funds, with RIFC unlikely to be able to pay December's wages. 
 Ashley also announced last month that he will not consider selling Newcastle until the end of next season at least. This is expected to remain the case, unless an offer substantially higher than the club's market value is received. 
 While the SFA has its own rules on dual ownership, the Premier League in England does not. The Football League does, though, along with Uefa, which means that if Ashley sought to increase his stake further - by challenging the SFA's stance in the courts - and Newcastle were relegated, or both Newcastle and Rangers qualified for Europe in future seasons, he would face further problems. 
 If Ashley did seek to raise his stake in Rangers, particularly if he was presented as the only viable option to the club's funding crisis, the SFA board would need to vote on the matter. Ashley is not the sole possible solution, though, since Dave King and investors aligned with the former Rangers director want to invest in RIFC in return for a controlling stake. 
 The Englishman already owns the naming rights of Ibrox Stadium and a commercial agreement over the club's retail sales through his Sports Direct company. The Sons of Struth fan group has already raised the prospect of boycotting his stores to try to persuade him to rescind the naming rights agreement. ###
319|||Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay, has joined senior naval officers and over 150 friends and family at Faslane to welcome home the submarine HMS Astute. HMS Astute: Royal welcome home for naval attack submarine Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay, has joined senior naval officers and over 150 friends and family at Faslane to welcome home the submarine HMS Astute.
The submarine is completing her inaugural deployment at a special ceremony at HM Naval Base Clyde.
Crew on HMS Astute have been away from their families for eight months. 
The Astute Class is described by the Royal Navy as their largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarine.
Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay is the submarine's Lady Sponsor. She attended the boat's commissioning ceremony at Faslane on 27 August 2010. 
She has been joined by the Royal Marine Band Scotland, as well as naval officers and families and friends of the crew, to welcome the submarine home.
After attending the reception at the Super Mess alongside friends and family of the crew, the Duchess said: &quot;I am so pleased to see everyone back in one piece. I believe there is a lot of catching up to do with wives, sons and brothers. I am proud to be the Sponsor of HMS Astute and wish all on board every success in the future.&quot;
HMS Astute arrived at her home port of HM Naval Base Clyde in 2009 and became part of the fleet in August 2010.
Commander Gareth Jenkins, the submarine's commanding officer, said: &quot;It was a tremendous honour for my ship's company and me to be welcomed home by Her Royal Highness. 
&quot;This deployment has been a huge success for HMS Astute. The submarine has travelled more than 27,000 miles and operated with our regional partners in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. 
&quot;The ship's company has been outstanding and I am pleased that so many of their families are here today to welcome them back to the home of the submarine service.&quot;
HMS Astute sailed from UK waters in March and was one of the first Astute Class to contribute to UK presence in the Mediterranean. 
The boat also passed through Gibraltar, Crete, the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Oman on its maiden deployment.
In August, new captain Commander Jenkins took control of the submarine from outgoing Commander Stephen Walker.###
320|||The third Astute Class submarine built at a Cumbria shipyard for the Royal Navy has completed its maiden dive. Third Astute submarine Artful makes maiden dive in Barrow The third Astute Class submarine built at a Cumbria shipyard for the Royal Navy has completed its maiden dive.
HMS Artful, a 97m-long 7,400-tonne nuclear-powered vessel is one of seven being built by BAE Systems in Barrow.
During the &quot;trim and incline test&quot;, it was submerged to allow naval architects to calculate its precise weight and centre of gravity and prove its safety and stability in the water.
BAE Systems described the operation as a &quot;significant milestone&quot;.
The first two submarines in the Astute class, HMS Astute and HMS Ambush, have now been handed over to the Royal Navy.
Four others - Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and the yet to be named seventh - are in various stages of construction.
They are capable of circumnavigating the world without the need to resurface.
Tony Johns, managing director of BAE Systems Submarines said: &quot;Successfully completing the trim and incline test is a significant milestone for Artful and a result of years of work by skilled engineers, naval architects and our operations team.
&quot;Our focus is now on completing final test and commissioning activities before she leaves Barrow for sea trials next year.&quot;###
321|||A former support worker who killed a woman he previously cared for has been jailed for five years and three months. Christopher Kelly jailed for killing Dorothy Beattie in Dunoon A former support worker who killed a woman he previously cared for has been jailed for five years and three months.
Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, on 22 May. 
The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children.
Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. 
The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. 
The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made &quot;derogatory&quot; remarks about his children. 
Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. 
He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing.
The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal &pound;300 from his victim's bank account. 
The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May.
Kelly apparently slept rough in Edinburgh until 28 May when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie.
Kelly told a doctor that &quot;something bad has happened&quot; adding: &quot;I think I killed her.&quot; 
He went on: &quot;I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. 
&quot;I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.&quot; 
Kelly also said: &quot;We're just pals - I had been her support worker.&quot; 
Police were called and Kelly told officers the last few days had been &quot;torture&quot;. 
The court heard Ms Beattie's injuries involved the use of &quot;significant force&quot;. 
Judge Lord Bannatyne said the jail-term would have been seven years, but for Kelly's guilty plea. 
The judge said: &quot;On any view, given what has been said, this is a tragic case.&quot; 
Kelly mouthed &quot;sorry&quot; to the victim's two daughters as was lead handcuffed to the cells.###

Dundee and Glasgow heroin gang jailed for 14 years Members of a gang caught transporting drugs and cash from deals between Dundee and Glasgow have been jailed for a total of 14 years.
Police caught Glasgow dealers supplying their Dundee counterparts with heroin.
William Anderson, Stephen Wilson and Leon Bruce, of Dundee, Robert Maxwell and Daniel Jebb, of Glasgow, and Jordan Mitchell, of Hamilton, pleaded guilty to being involved in the scheme.
Lord Boyd told them drug dealing was &quot;an evil and vile trade&quot;.
The six pleaded guilty to drugs supply and money laundering charges committed between May and August 2013 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Anderson, 26, was jailed for three years, Wilson, 41, for three years and three months, and Jebb, 64, for two years and two months.
Maxwell, 57, was jailed for five years and seven months. 
Sentence was deferred on 40-year-old Bruce for him to be of good behaviour, while fellow minor player Mitchell, 24, was sentenced to 240 hours of community service.
Sentencing, Lord Boyd said: &quot;The supply of illegal drugs, particularly class A drugs, is an evil and vile trade.
&quot;It blights communities and the lives of individuals as you well know.&quot;###

Glasgow City: Boss Eddie Wolecki Black calls for 'mature' display  Glasgow City manager Eddie Wolecki Black wants his side to show they have learned from past experience when they face Medyk Konin in the Champions League. 
 City visit the Polish outfit for the first leg of their last 32 match on Wednesday. 
 &quot;I expect more mature performances,&quot; Black told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;We've been at this stage for a number of years so there's no excuses for not turning in mature performances.&quot; 
 Glasgow have never progressed beyond the last 16 stage of the Uefa competition and Black admits they have to change their style when they take on continental opposition. 
 &quot;All year long the players play to win a league title and this is what it brings you,&quot; said Black, whose side recently won their eighth SWPL title in a row. 
 &quot;We've come through the qualifying group and are quite confident that if we play well over the two legs we can get good results. 
 &quot;They're a talented young team with good pace and energy. We've done our homework. It'll certainly be a tough game because they're going to give it their all as it's their first time at this stage. 
 &quot;It is a big step up, you're playing against better quality players, quicker players, stronger players with very good coaches. The Uefa tournament embraces everything that you would want as a coach to challenge you. 
 &quot;If you go and play foreign sides at your own game domestically there's a good chance you'll get taken apart so you have to go with a completely different game plan. I'm hopeful we can show that this time. 
 &quot;I'll be really content if we're still in this tie come the end of the 90 minutes, that's always my key. I just want to progress one game at a time.&quot; 
 Skipper Leanne Ross is also relishing City's chance to prove themselves in Europe. 
 &quot;Anytime you get to the knockout stages it's really exciting, so we're good to go,&quot; she said. 
 &quot;We have high standards so we're hoping to get through this tie then we can look forward to the last 16. Nothing's a gimme at this stage so we have to work as hard as we can and prepare well for the game.&quot; ###
324|||Glasgow Warriors prop Zander Fagerson believes young rugby players must be willing to make sacrifices in fulfilling their professional dream. Glasgow Warriors: Lifestyle key for debutant Zander Fagerson  Glasgow Warriors prop Zander Fagerson believes young rugby players must be willing to make sacrifices in fulfilling their professional dream. 
 The 18-year-old tight-head made his debut in the 40-23 win at Treviso. 
 &quot;It's a complete lifestyle choice but a great choice when you do make it,&quot; Fagerson told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;When your friends are going on nights out and stuff, you sort of have to say 'sorry, I can't go' because you have to do pool recovery or something.&quot; 
 Fagerson, from Kirriemuir, was a second half replacement in Italy and played a crucial part in helping Gregor Townsend's side defend the lead when reduced to 13 men. 
&quot;It would be absolutely amazing if I did. I want to play at the highest level possible, so if the opportunity came around I would definitely grasp it. It's always in the back of my mind that I'd love to play for Scotland and go further on but I'll just take each game as it comes.&quot;
 But it was not all plain-sailing on the former Glasgow Hawks man's journey to being an Elite Development player. 
 &quot;There was a point in my career when I though I wasn't getting a look in,&quot; said Fagerson, capped at U18 and U20 level. 
 &quot;I was in a terrible place and was sort of depressed and not happy at all. My mum said: 'why are you depressed? You're giving in; you're letting the people that put you down win'. 
 &quot;So I strive by proving people wrong. If you work hard, change your lifestyle and get determined, they've got nothing to come back at you with. 
 &quot;If I eat lots of carbohydrates I'll just put the weight on and it's not good weight. Organisation of your meals is important - what you're going to be eating and when you're going to be eating - and recovery after the games is completely crucial.&quot; 
&quot;Our whole aim for the season is to be the first Scottish team to win the competition. Glasgow Warriors, for me, is a big family. Everyone's friends, there's no enemies. The level of professionalism is at that peak and I definitely think this could be the year.&quot;
 Fagerson, a former pupil of the High School of Dundee and Strathallan School, revealed he was &quot;over the moon&quot; to make his Warriors debut. 
 And getting the call in the Pro12 took him by surprise, even though it came after a successful run-out for the Glasgow 'A' side versus Edinburgh 'A' in September. 
 &quot;When I took that first step onto the pitch I thought 'please don't muck this up',&quot; recalled Fagerson, who Townsend described as &quot;outstanding&quot; against Treviso. 
 &quot;But when I made my first tackle and scrum all the nervous energy went away. I got my head down and tried to do my jobs well. 
 &quot;Al Kellock was a massive influence on me. He just made sure that if I was nervous or a bit lost he would always help me out. He was absolutely fantastic. 
 &quot;There were loads of other individuals - it's a great family atmosphere at Glasgow and everyone put an arm round me and said 'good luck. After the game it was a great experience with them all saying 'well done'.&quot; ###
325|||Glasgow will have to improve to maintain their sensational start to the Pro 12 campaign, according to head coach Gregor Townsend. Glasgow: Head coach Gregor Townsend wary of Ulster threat  Glasgow will have to improve to maintain their sensational start to the Pro 12 campaign, according to head coach Gregor Townsend. 
 The Warriors went top of the table with five wins from five thanks to a 40-23 bonus point win away to Treviso. 
 Townsend was happy with the character shown by his charges, but says they will have to step up away to Ulster. 
 &quot;It'll be much tougher next week and we'll have to play much better to beat Ulster,&quot; Townsend told BBC Scotland. 
 Treviso took a 10-0 lead early in the match before Glasgow rallied. 
 Tommy Seymour scored two tries, with Tyrone Holmes, James Eddie, DTH van der Merwe and Sean Lamont also crossing. 
 Warriors, who finished runners-up in the Pro-12 last term, leapfrogged Ospreys at the summit thanks to the triumph in Italy. 
 &quot;It's great to get a win away from home and we have two more games before the November Test so we want to keep the momentum going,&quot; Townsend added. 
&quot;There were times, particularly at the beginning of the game, when we weren't accurate enough in attack. We need to keep our discipline a lot better defensively but the way the players stuck to their task in the second half was terrific.&quot;
 &quot;We've got to recognise that coming out to Italy in great weather, it's a different environment and we adapted well enough to score six tries and get the bonus point win. 
 &quot;We gave Treviso some possession to attack us in dangerous areas and they played very well. They came with a real attacking intent and deserved their lead. For our players to take their opportunities and score three tries in that first half was very good. 
 &quot;There were times, particularly at the beginning of the game, when we weren't accurate enough in attack. We need to keep our discipline a lot better defensively but the way the players stuck to their task in the second half was terrific. 
 &quot;When we were down to 13 men at the end it was great to see Treviso couldn't score a try during that period. 
 &quot;Our expectations are very high on what we have to deliver in training and games, and at times today it wasn't the standards we set ourselves. We know it will have to be much better next week, we're going to a very tough venue and are up against a very good team in Ulster. We're going to have to be at our very best to have another chance to win.&quot; ###
326|||Hamilton Academical chairman Les Gray admits the club may have to reassess their season target after a blistering start to the campaign. Hamilton: Chairman Les Gray dreaming of top six finish  Hamilton Academical chairman Les Gray admits the club may have to reassess their season target after a blistering start to the campaign. 
 The newly-promoted Accies are top of the Scottish Premiership after a first victory at Celtic Park in 76 years. 
 &quot;I don't think it gets better than this for us to be honest,&quot; Gray told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;We started the season looking to stay in the league, that is our priority, top six would be beyond our dreams.&quot; 
 Alex Neil's men, who came through a penalty shoot-out in May's play-off final, have lost just once this term - on the opening day against Inverness. 
 &quot;I think the boys should enjoy it while it lasts,&quot; added Gray. &quot;They've worked very hard and Alex has done a terrific job with a young group who have a lot of potential. 
 &quot;If we're to aim for a top six position and get the budget that goes with that, then that allows us to get more money to plough into our youth set-up.&quot; 
 The 1-0 triumph over champions Celtic on Sunday, courtesy of Ali Crawford's strike, highlighted the job player-boss Neil has done at New Douglas Park despite a modest budget. 
 The 33-year-old replaced Billy Reid in April 2013 with the Lanarkshire club toiling to regain its place in the top flight. 
 However, less than a year-and-a-half later, the Accies are looking down on all the rest. 
 &quot;Alex has been part of this for eight or nine years and groomed as an under-17 manager, under-20 manager, now the first team coach and player,&quot; explained Gray. 
 &quot;He's played with a lot of these boys and brought them through, and I think he finished the game (at Celtic Park) with eight academy players on the pitch. 
 &quot;A lot is said about budgets and money, but that doesn't really come into it for us, we've got a model that works for us. 
 &quot;We bring kids in at a very young age and they're not paid a lot of money but are highly incentivised to get to the first team, to win. 
 &quot;I think that's the way we will continue to progress and if that doesn't work and we end up in the bottom tier we'll still do it our way. 
 &quot;We won't change our philosophy.&quot; 
 Manager Neil hailed &quot;a magnificent win&quot; over Celtic and was keen to point out that his charges had merited the victory. 
 &quot;We went there with a game-plan,&quot; he told BBC Scotland. &quot;I had belief in the players and said to them before the match that if they played to their full potential we had an opportunity to go and get something from the game - and that's the way it happened. 
 &quot;At Celtic Park you're always going to have to ride your luck. 
 &quot;First half they didn't have a great deal, a couple of bits and bobs. Second half they had a few real good opportunities where they will probably think they should have done better, but as the game wore on we had some good opportunities ourselves. I think our opportunities are ones we really should score.&quot; ###
327|||Both managers called for a sense of perspective following Hamilton's 1-0 victory at Celtic Park on Sunday. Long-term strategy buoys Hamilton as Celtic seek immediate answers  Both managers called for a sense of perspective following Hamilton's 1-0 victory at Celtic Park on Sunday. 
 Alex Neil did not want the extent of the achievement - the club's first away win over Celtic in the league since 1938 - to define it as a unique event when he is so confident of the players' abilities and the purpose of Hamilton's play bringing sustained progress this season. 
 Ronny Deila was more concerned with reducing the impact of a negative result. He sought solace in statistics, since the home side created a series of chances that were spurned by strikers whose aim and composure was askew. Even so, the reaction of frustrated fans was a reminder that expectations at Celtic do not provide much room for leeway. 
 How is the game best surmised? Nobody was wholly surprised that Hamilton won, or that Celtic are still flawed. 
 Deila's side lacked ruthlessness up front and remained vulnerable in defence. On the balance of chances created, Celtic ought to have won but then Hamilton can legitimately point out that Dougie Imrie might have scored early on and Louis Longridge could have presented a clear chance to Tony Andreu in the second half rather than shooting wide. 
 The outcome confirmed that Hamilton have carried their form, confidence, organisation and self-belief of last season into this campaign, and that Celtic remain a work in progress. 
 It is too early for outright condemnation of Deila but he needs a run of results to establish a period of authority. 
 Celtic did not appoint the Norwegian to merely repeat the work of Neil Lennon, his predecessor. The club wants to push the limits of what their overall strategy might achieve, so recruited a manager with a reputation for maximising performances and player development. 
 It will take time for Deila to implement all of his strategies but there is also an obligation on him to make Celtic capable in the meantime. 
 Hamilton's performances are the result of a long and sustained strategy of youth development and playing with a certain style and philosophy. Five of the players who started on Sunday are graduates from the club's youth set up, while two more came on as substitutes. Only three starting players were older than 26. 
 Neil and his assistant Frankie McAvoy regularly attend under-20, under-17 and under-15 matches, while Neil started his coaching career at the club with the youth age groups so had worked with many of the players already before he took charge of the first-team. 
 When the club won promotion by defeating Hibernian in the play-offs, the message from the executives and directors was clear: the strategy would not change. 
 Neil has benefited from this but also his own strongly-held belief that his players are capable of taking the game to any Premiership opponent. 
 Hamilton did not stockpile time-served top-flight players during the summer and that was down to the conviction that some of the players approaching their breakthrough into the first-team are talented enough. 
 Deila is in a different part of that cycle of development. He wants his team to play a higher tempo pressing game and made some pointed remarks about the fitness of his players and for old habits to be discarded. 
 He is right, in the sense that the Scottish game is still too enthralled in the drinking and laddish escapades of previous eras. The benchmark is how the best teams and leagues in Europe are developing players, not fuzzy memories of Kenny Dalglish having liked a black pudding supper on a Friday evening.

 Nonetheless, Deila will begin to sound like a hollow preacher if his team does not find the means to put together an impressive run. Fans will lose patience, too. He has to combine his medium-term aims and beliefs with a short-term focus on results. 
 After all, the two are not mutually exclusive but it might mean sacrificing in the short-term some of his principles to play in a way that better suits his resources. 
 Celtic have the resources and players to win the title. Deila has only been in charge since the summer and there is time enough for the team to develop its old habit of being dominant, at least on the domestic stage. 
 Even so, Dundee United and Aberdeen are capable of stringing victories together and at this stage it looks as though Hamilton will be able to maintain their form, even if a couple of defeats might disrupt their mood of optimism. 
 Hamilton can revel in a period of carefree ambition. Problems have accumulated for Celtic and Deila needs to find solutions quickly, particularly the soundness of his defence and the dynamic among his attacking players. 
 He came to Scotland with a low-profile, which means that there was no reputation for him to rely upon in times of scrutiny. He needs to build trust and make a persuasive case that he can construct a period of achievement at Celtic. 
 Hamilton's win was a reminder of the worth of continuity but also of a clear-headed and long-term planning. 
 Is the Celtic job too big for Deila? It is too early to make a definitive judgement but his team was not too big for Hamilton to bring down. ###
328|||BUDGET airline chief executive tells Annie Brown why he had to stop fighting with passengers. The words you thought you'd never hear from Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary - 'I'm sorry' - Daily Record FASTEN your seatbelts, prepare for a shock landing.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has apologised to all those customers his airline upset, disappointed and generally let down over the last few years.
He said: “I am sorry about the way we have mishandled some passengers in the past and that is something we need to learn from.
“We were contemptuous of customer service and civility. We want to make low fare travel affordable but also an option of choice. We won’t irritate you or p*** you off, particularly about stuff that doesn’t matter.”
This is the man who called passengers idiots, who said they should pay for being “stupid”.
Now he says: “We were fighting with customers over things that really weren’t important. Whether the bag was a millimetre over the bloody size really didn’t matter.”
The change in him is seismic. But why? He said: “I think I was young and very driven and some of it was a deliberate business decision. Any publicity was good publicity.
Generally the bad sold more seats.
“As a formula, that worked fine for a couple of years but people just see through that after a while.”
Yesterday he was in Scotland for a Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting, where he joked he is “manifestly unsuitable for employment in any properly functioning industry”.
He is on a PR drive for the launch of the new winter schedule, beefing up the routes from Glasgow but having slashed routes in Prestwick.
He forecasts more of the business routes, to London and Dublin, will go to Glasgow and Prestwick will hold on to its existing international flights and, only just, its survival.
 

 He blames airport passenger duty for strangling Prestwick but insists he could double the 750,000  passengers flowing through it, and allow it to break even, if the tax is devolved and scrapped. He said: “I think that may well happen. 
“One of the great outcomes of the referendum is you frightened the life out of the Westminster establishment. They want to throw Scotland bones and APD could well be one of them.”
Last year, the airline had 82million passengers and this year it will be 87million, almost three times that of British Airways. O’Leary wants to increase the three million coming to Scotland to seven.
But his charm offensive is from the pocket rather than the heart.
He said: “Ultimately everything is about profit, otherwise you die. We won the battle on price but we want to double in size and that’s not going to be done being as cheap as chips.
“It is going to need the delivery of a really good service, and catering to different sections of the market like business passengers and families.
“I think I have spent too long being always right. Now I am learning that listening to feedback from customers, generally the critical stuff, is the way to run the business better.“###
329|||THE internet can help manage bills, save money and even provide entertainment, but 20 per cent of Scots are still not online. Scottish Government launch Lets Get On campaign to teach Scots the benefits of the internet - Daily Record  

A major drive has been launched to get people from all walks of life to take advantage of the internet.
Spearheaded by the Scottish Government, the ‘Let’s Get On’ campaign is being run in partnership with organisations from the public and private sector under the overall Digital Scotland brand.
Libraries, clubs and community organisations across the country are supporting the campaign and offering people the opportunity to join classes and support groups, showing them how to go online and get the most from the internet.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: “Recent statistics show almost 20% of the population in Scotland are still not using the internet and so missing out on its benefits.
“Whether you want to get a job, catch up on the latest football fixtures, find the best deals or get connected with friends and family, getting online can help and is easier than you think.
“We believe that working in partnership with organisations who have the same vision as we do – to see people and businesses make the most of digital connectivity, get online and enjoy the benefits that the internet can bring – will help us achieve our goal of a fairer, wealthier and smarter digital Scotland.”
Jane McDougal, 24, from Glasgow, knew how to use the internet but joined a digital class to help increase her knowledge of word processing and email to help with her search for work.
She is now completing a Scottish Qualifications Authority [SQA] course to gain more experience and a qualification to give her an added advantage in her applications.
Jane said: “I wasn’t too good with word processing, emailing people or being able to attach letters and CVs. I feel like the course has really helped my confidence. I’ve helped everybody else in the class to log on or look online.”
 

The SQA have developed a computer basics training course in support of Let’s Get On, which offers easy access to internet training.
The Learn My Way course offers formal recognition of new skills with a qualification on successful completion. Signing up to the course is free and each participant is given a personal account allowing them to work through the course either in a Digital Scotland learning centre such as a public library, at home or another location where there is internet connection.

330|||IT is believed 33-year-old Kelly wants to copy one-eyed Cregan, who is serving life for murdering constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicole Hughes, 23, and two gangland rivals. Fugitive machete thug Jonathan Kelly compares himself to killer Dale Cregan and threatens to shoot police officers - Daily Record A VIOLENT fugitive has styled himself on police killer Dale Cregan and is threatening to shoot officers.
Jonathan Kelly is armed and prepared to kill if police close in on him.
A friend said: “He’s got a shotgun and if the police get him, he’s going to take one of them out. He’s planning to kill an officer.
“He’s a dangerous man who needs to be caught.”
Kelly, who paralysed a man with a machete, went on the run last month after breaching bail conditions.
He has a string of convictions for violence and is listed as one of the UK’s most wanted criminals on a Crimestoppers hitlist.
The source said Kelly, 33, cut off his electronic tag before going into hiding.
It is claimed the thug wants to emulate one-eyed Cregan, 31, who is serving life for murdering constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, and two gangland rivals.
The source added: “Kelly’s getting help to hide from police.
“He used my phone to contact one of Edinburgh’s best-known gangsters.
“It was just before he ran away and he was asking for money.
“He planned the whole thing and he’s not going to give himself up.
“He’s comparing himself to Dale Cregan.
“He said to me, ‘I’m not going back to jail for something stupid’.”
 

Kelly, of Drumchapel, Glasgow, has boasted about the machete horror and about attacking gay people.
He has also bragged about a catalogue of violent offences in prison .
He went on the run after he was made the subject of 32 strict conditions following his release from Low Moss prison in Lanarkshire.
A team of dedicated officers have been trying to flush him out but he keeps giving them the slip.
Last month, armed officers swooped on a block of flats on Glasgow’s south side after being tipped off that Kelly was inside .
But the hardened criminal managed to get away.
Detectives are quizzing Kelly’s former prison associates in a bid to track him down.
The Daily Record revealed that while Kelly was in prison, he wrote to campaign group Miscarriages of Justice UK to brag about his life of violence.
In the letter, Kelly said he was initially locked up for the machete attack .
He boasted in the letter: “While on remand in Barlinnie, I told screws not to put another con in my cell or I would be forced to hurt him.
“After a couple of hours, I repeatedly slashed and stabbed him. If it hadn’t been for night staff, he would have died.”
Kelly got five years for that assault and was moved to
Kilmarnock jail, where he says he “lasted only three or four months before assaulting two prisoners”.
He claimed he then began attacking officers because they were playing “mind games” with him.
Kelly said he attacked three warders in three days and was moved to Perth, where he staged a dirty protest and assaulted officers “at any opportunity I got”.
He said he has also attacked staff at Shotts, Glenochil, Edinburgh, Barlinnie and Addiewell jails and bragged: “Seven High Court trials, but only three convictions.”
Detective Inspector Ian Hylands, from Drumchapel police station, said: “Significant police inquiries are ongoing to trace Mr Kelly.
“However, there have been no positive sightings.
“Unfortunately, we have had very little information from the public regarding his whereabouts.
“Although we do not consider him to be a danger to the public, we do believe that he may pose a risk.
“We would advise the public not to approach Mr Kelly but to contact police immediately via 999.
“It is imperative that the public get in touch with any information they think may lead us to where he is.”
At Preston Crown Court in June last year, Cregan, 31, was ordered to serve a whole life sentence.
He killed the PCs near Manchester in September 2012 after making a hoax emergency call to police.###
331|||THE 400m hurdles silver medallist has announced her support for the Beatson Cancer Charity where she will back fundraising campaigns. Commonwealth Games star Eilidh Child appointed as ambassador to cancer charity - Daily Record COMMONWEALTH Games medallist Eilidh Child said she is &quot;extremely proud&quot; to have been appointed a cancer charity ambassador.
The 400m hurdles star announced her support for the Beatson Cancer Charity on a visit to Beatson West of&nbsp;Scotland&nbsp;Cancer Centre in Glasgow, where she met patients and staff today.
The Beatson is the UK's busiest cancer care centre and sees more than 8,000 new patients every year.
Child, 27, from Perth, represented Britain at London 2012 and took silver at Glasgow 2014. She celebrated gold at the European Championships in the summer.
She said: &quot;I am extremely proud to be one of the charity's first ambassadors.
&quot;I have been really inspired meeting some of the cancer nurses funded by the charity, not to mention the positive attitude of patients and families affected by this dreadful disease.
&quot;I want to do as much as I can to boost fundraising.&quot;
Head of fundraising Charlene Elliott said: &quot;It's fantastic to have a much-loved Scottish Olympian and European champion on board as one of our first ambassadors.
&quot;We are grateful that Eilidh has chosen to give her time to help us raise the profile of the charity and support our fundraising activities.&quot;###
332|||THE organisation say all that has changed is that food stamps have been swapped for foodbanks as many struggle to make both ends meet across 100 years. Glasgow North West foodbank drive says hunger of city's needy has lasted more than a century with World War 1 theme night - Daily Record FOOD poverty is not new to Glasgow and a weekend event aimed to remind residents that the city’s needy remain as much an issue now as a century ago.
Glasgow North West Foodbank held a fundraising evening to further their work helping families, many of whom get caught in bureaucracy as benefits change or while waiting for the first pay cheque from a new job.
Manager Kyle McCormick said they chose a World War I theme not only for the centenary being marked this year, but also to point out that food poverty remains a problem 100 years on.
He said: “We had foodstamps then and foodbanks now. It seems like we are going around in circles. Most of our clients are being referred because of benefit delays and changes. A lot of people have debt problems and are struggling with mortgages and waiting for social housing. We are trying to focus on making their money stretch further. During WWI there was a lot to help your money go further.”
Kyle – who was joined by wife Gill for Friday’s event at Blawarthill Parish Church in Yoker – said too many people were living week to week. He added: “There are 50 branches of foodbanks in Glasgow. I would hope to see that reduced in the next few years.”
Olivia Dalzell, 45, started volunteering at the Trussell Trust-run foodbank after a friend had to turn to it for help.
She said: “I didn’t know anything about foodbanks. I was feeding my friend and all the money she was getting was single person benefit and once she paid what she could of her bills, she couldn’t feed herself. She got a &pound;1000 fine for not having a TV licence because she couldn’t afford to pay it.
 “We’re very lucky to have a foodbank or a lot of kids would be starving. There are a lot of big-hearted people out there but if it was not for foodbanks, people  would be starving. We shouldn’t have to rely on foodbanks.” 
Donations of food and other items were made by local businesses, including Joanna Goodbite in Knightswood.
Olivia added: “People have been very generous for a good cause.”
George Square recently became the site for an impromptu foodbank drive. ###
333|||THE charity, who help shelter thousands of women each year, are hoping the public will donate items such as bedding and crockery to help make their refuges more homely. Glasgow Women's Aid turn to Amazon wish list and Glaswegian generosity to help furnish refuge flats - Daily Record A CHARITY have turned to the power of the internet and Glaswegian generosity in a bid to improve the lives of abused women.
Glasgow Women’s Aid are asking kind-hearted residents to use a wish list on the Amazon website to donate items to help make their refuge flats, which shelter victims of domestic abuse, more homely.
The charity say crucial touches of homeliness could make the difference between a woman staying in a refuge to be supported by the charity or returning to an abusive partner.
GWA’s Marie Farry said creating a welcoming environment can be a vital element in protecting victims of abuse.
Explaining the idea behind their internet wish list, the charity’s children’s team leader said: “It’s important that when women are seeking refuge from an abusive relationship they’re going into a homely environment.
“Things get worn out, they get old, and you have people arriving at the refuge and going into a flat that’s really pretty shabby.
“There could be negative implications to that. So we thought, let’s ask for specific things that will make it more welcoming. I also think people who want to support victims like the idea of donating something specific rather than cash.”
The first refuge operated by GWA was a Gorbals flat donated in 1973.
At the time, it was unfit for human habitation – and Marie believes a negative impression of refuge accommodation may linger today.
She said: “Obviously, if women are leaving their own homes to come to us you want it to be a pleasant place for them and their children to come into. If it’s a bit of a dump, it can increase the likelihood they may go back.
“Women do go back, and they do so for different reasons. But you don’t want the reason to be that the flat was a dump.”
It costs the charity, who maintain four refuges as well as satellite flats across Glasgow, &pound;5500 a year to maintain a flat.
They accommodate more than 100 women each year.
The Amazon wish list features items such as cutlery, cooking utensils, crockery, towels, sofa throws, lamps, microwaves, televisions and pictures.
The charity, who last year supported 1290 women overall, also intend to use it to appeal for Christmas gifts for the people they help.
Marie added: “At Christmas, we get a lot of donations for children, and not so many for women – and while Christmas is all about children, it’s important women get gifts as well.
“GWA strive to offer the best possible accommodation that we can afford and families thrive in a comfortable environment, settle in quicker and feel inspired to succeed when they finally gain a home of their own.
“This itself is our reward for helping women and children escape domestic abuse.”

334|||THE budget airline chief executive explains why he had to stop fighting with passengers. Ryanair says sorry: The words you never thought you'd hear from airline's boss Michael O'Leary - Daily Record FASTEN your seatbelts, prepare for a shock landing.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has apologised to all those customers his airline upset, disappointed and generally let down over the last few years.
He said: “I am sorry about the way we have mishandled some passengers in the past and that is something we need to learn from.
“We were contemptuous of customer service and civility. We want to make low fare travel affordable but also an option of choice. We won’t irritate you or p*** you off, particularly about stuff that doesn’t matter.”
This is the man who called passengers idiots, who said they should pay for being “stupid”.
Now he says: “We were fighting with customers over things that really weren’t important. Whether the bag was a millimetre over the bloody size really didn’t matter.”
The change in him is seismic. But why? He said: “I think I was young and very driven and some of it was a deliberate business decision. Any publicity was good publicity.
Generally the bad sold more seats.
“As a formula, that worked fine for a couple of years but people just see through that after a while.”
Yesterday he was in Scotland for a Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting, where he joked he is “manifestly unsuitable for employment in any properly functioning industry”.
He is on a PR drive for the launch of the new winter schedule, beefing up the routes from Glasgow but having slashed routes in Prestwick.
He forecasts more of the business routes, to London and Dublin, will go to Glasgow and Prestwick will hold on to its existing international flights and, only just, its survival.
 

He blames airport passenger duty for strangling Prestwick but insists he could double the 750,000 passengers flowing through it, and allow it to break even, if the tax is devolved and scrapped. He said: “I think that may well happen.
“One of the great outcomes of the referendum is you frightened the life out of the Westminster establishment. They want to throw Scotland bones and APD could well be one of them.”
Last year, the airline had 82million passengers and this year it will be 87million, almost three times that of British Airways. O’Leary wants to increase the three million coming to Scotland to seven.
But his charm offensive is from the pocket rather than the heart.
He said: “Ultimately everything is about profit, otherwise you die. We won the battle on price but we want to double in size and that’s not going to be done being as cheap as chips.
“It is going to need the delivery of a really good service, and catering to different sections of the market like business passengers and families.
“I think I have spent too long being always right. Now I am learning that listening to feedback from customers, generally the critical stuff, is the way to run the business better.“###

Whyte has been threatened with up to 28 days in jail if he fails to attend a court date on September 29 after having absent for hearings held in May and July.
According to a ruling by Mr Justice Arnold, Whyte “seeks to frustrate the court’s orders” over his involvement in a legal dispute with Ticketus, the firm that successfully sought legal action against Whyte, who was forced to hand over nearly &pound;20 million in damages.
Sky Sports News report that a transcript from the judge’s ruling shows Ticketus’ legal representatives attempting to contact the former Rangers owner without success, leaving texts and voicemails to a number known to have been used by Whyte.
In the ruling, Mr Justice Arnold wrote: “It seems to me to be clear from the evidence that the first defendant has adopted a policy of evading service and failing to communicate with the claimants’ solicitors, and in those ways it appears he seeks to frustrate the court’s orders. It seems to me that the order should be for committal for 28 days suspended upon the usual basis.”

336|||A VETERAN teacher with a volcanic temper has been struck off after a hearing was told he once challenged a schoolboy to a fight Angry ‘out of control’ Glasgow teacher struck off A VETERAN teacher with a volcanic temper has been struck off after a hearing was told he once challenged a schoolboy to a fight.


Maths teacher Francis Carlton was “out of control”, frightening senior staff and pupils alike with his outbursts.

• Keep up to date with all aspects of Scottish life with The Scotsman iPhone app, completely free to download and use.

The 65-year-old threatened one boy with revealing highly sensitive information about him to the whole class.
On another occasion the Glasgow teacher yelled so loudly at boys in a corridor that a colleague left her room to investigate, watching as a red-faced Mr Carlton yelled at a boy: “Are you stupid?”
And a headteacher told how Mr Carlton once ushered a boy out of his class, locked the door, and was then seen holding a “metre stick”.
Mr Carlton told a disciplinary hearing of the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) this week that he suffers from work-related stress, high blood pressure and irritable bowel syndrome.
He said he should not have been left to teach “miscreants” at Drumchapel and Castlemilk high schools and said city council officials should “hang their heads in shame” for not supporting him.
The hearing in Edinburgh found seven charges proven against Mr Carlton.
These included threatening to make false allegations against pupils, threatening to publicly disclose confidential information about a pupil, acting aggressively and acting in an unprofessional manner regarding test papers.
Donna McMaster, 48, acting head of Drumchapel in 2012, said: “On January 9, you were ushering a pupil out of a door, you locked the door and I saw you standing with a metre stick in your hands.”
She said she had further concerns when she heard reports that at a previous school Mr Carlton “had challenged a boy to a fight in class – something that was “swept under the carpet”.
Mrs McMaster said another incident took place on March 8, 2012, when he told a vulnerable child that he would “tell the whole class of his situation”.
She said he told the pupil and mother: “I know what you’ve been up to. Do you want me to tell the whole class?
“The pupil’s mother was shocked. I was outraged, said Mrs McMaster”
Anne Mallon, 54, a work experience officer at Castlemilk, said she heard Mr Carlton “shouting at the top of his voice” during an outburst on October 24, 2012.
She said: “I observed him to be shouting at one pupil, ‘Take that smirk off your face’ and ‘Are you stupid?’.
“I was shocked by what I saw. I observed his face being a deep red – the child looked startled.”
“It was clear in my mind Mr Carlton was out of control, out of order. I have never witnessed this before.”
Mr Carlton, who represented himself at the hearing, denied the charges and claimed witnesses were unreliable.
He asked: “Are these miscreant pupils the most reliable to ask? Some of the incidents were only seen in the classroom.”
He added: “I was suffering from severe physical trauma caused by stress.
“I don’t understand why I was given control of the lesser forming classes even though these are known to be the most challenging.”
After the GTCS announced its decision to strike him off, Mr Carlton said: “I think that certain individuals at Glasgow City Council should hang their heads in shame for not giving me support when I needed it.” 
Mr Carlton declined to comment as he left the building.

The Ultimo founder appeared on Good Morning Britain yesterday and voiced her concerns over the severity of the abuse she received.
She said: “I’ve got over it now, but it was really severe. When you block someone on Twitter you can send a report, but I never heard back from Twitter once, so that’s what worries me especially when it comes to children. When kids get bullied at school in the playground people say things in the heat of the moment.
“But when someone’s sitting behind a keyboard it’s like a hundred times worse because they just attack in a very severe way.”

340|||HUMZA YOUSAF says that councils who are using historic levels of voter turnout in the referendum to pursue outstanding poll tax debt should be ashamed. Humza Yousaf: Record independence referendum turnout should not be used to chase poll tax - Humza Yousaf - Daily Record ONE of the great successes of the referendum campaign was the engagement and involvement of so many Glaswegians.
People who had never been involved in a political campaign, or who were sceptical of the political process, became inspired by the ideas put forward in the campaign and made their voices heard.
One of the ways that this engagement was demonstrated was by the high voter turnout in Glasgow at 75 per cent and the thousands who registered to vote – some for the first time in their lives.
These people registered in good faith, so they could take part in a historic referendum. So it was shocking to see some Scottish councils use information from the electoral roll in a wrongheaded breach of that faith, by pursuing people for historic poll tax debt .
Glasgow was the hub of the fight against the poll tax – the very first anti-poll tax union were established in Maryhill in April 1987 and the Scottish Anti-Poll Tax Federation were based in Pollok.
The campaign against it involved people from various political parties and Glasgow showed its strong opposition to this unfair tax by having one of the lowest rates of poll tax collection in the UK.
Last week, First Minister Alex Salmond announced that legislation would be introduced to stop councils chasing these historic debts. The news is very welcome indeed.
Sadly – but not surprisingly – the Tories seem to be against these plans.
I have written to Johann Lamont and requested that Labour back the plan to stop any pursuit of ancient debts. That would send out a powerful signal that Scotland is united – regardless of political party ties – in delivering what is best for the people who live and work in Scotland.
I wholeheartedly accept the result of the referendum and will be working hard as part of the Scottish Government to ensure that the Westminster party leaders keep to the solemn vow on substantial new powers for the Scottish Parliament.
For the people who voted No because of this promise of greater powers and for the many people in Glasgow who voted Yes as they wanted Scotland to have the full powers of an independent country, it is vital that this vow is kept.
A recent poll has shown that 71 per cent of people support control over all tax raised in Scotland, 75 per cent support control over all welfare and benefits, while 65 per cent support control of policy on the state pension.
There is clearly strong support for extensive new powers. However, we are now seeing Prime Minister David Cameron attempting to backtrack by linking new powers for Scotland to English votes for English laws.
People in Scotland were clearly promised substantial additional powers by a set timetable by the Westminster parties and the Tories should not be attempting to row back on that vow.
It is time for the Scottish Parliament to have the powers we need to make Scotland a fairer, more equal country and address the causes of inequality. Cameron made a promise to the Scottish people and he must now honour it.
LAST WEEK I had the pleasure of presenting Saltire Awards to pupils at Rosshall Secondary, to recognise their hard work and commitment to volunteering.
The Saltire Awards allow young people to record the skills, experience and learning they gained through volunteering they have experienced.
The pupils I met at Rosshall were a great cohort of change-makers. Well done to them all, and to pupils across Glasgow working towards their Saltire Awards.
FINALLY , I would like to pay tribute to Alan Henning, the British aid worker who was brutally murdered by ISIL extremists. Alan was a true hero and his family and friends remain in my thoughts and prayers.###

342|||WE spoke to the two industry experts to separate the Ghost in the Shells from the Giovanni's Islands. Scotland Loves Anime 2014: Writer Jonathan Clements and festival director Andrew Partridge open up on animation celebration - Daily Record JONATHAN CLEMENTS is a scriptwriter and a leading expert on anime. A prolific author, he has published many non-fiction works that serve as research for his fiction. Writer of Anime: A History and Schoolgirl Milky Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trade, he is also a visiting professor at a university in China.
 
 Jonathan thanks for taking the time to speak to us. This isn’t your first time at Scotland Loves Anime (SLA)? 
I've been introducing the films since the first SLA, and chairing the festival jury since the second. I tell the crowd gossip about the films, and I interview the Japanese guests on stage. This means I have to sit through every pre-film advert at the GFT about two dozen times.&nbsp; I earn my money.
 How, if at all, have you seen the festival change over time? 
We get a lot of repeat customers, so there are familiar faces now every year. It makes the crowd very friendly and the hecklers very bold. I don't think the festival has changed on the outside, but the organisers have certainly refined their protocols over the years. We have all sorts of systems in place to deal with untalkative guests (this usually involves whisky) or stressful premieres (actually, come to think of it, this also involves whisky).
 

 Do you think there has been a changing appreciation or opinion of the medium in Scotland? 
I think that the Scots are getting used to an annual film festival of Japanese cartoons in their midst, which itself makes anime part of the scenery here. We don't get asked &quot;Anime? What's that?&quot; We get asked &quot;SLA, when's that?&quot; which is a real result.
I think the real change is outside Scotland, because now there is a palpable sense among, English fans that if you really want to see the new premieres first, you need to be booking yourself some time in Scotland every autumn. We had some people show up from France for one movie a couple of years ago. And there was a nutter who came all the way from Japan.
 You write non-fiction as part of your research for your fictional works. To what degree do you think anime is grounded in reality? 
Ooh, well that's a complicated question. Anime is very much grounded in realism, which is to say most of the good stuff sets up rules for the world in which it happens, and then sticks to them. Giant robots are heavy; magic spells have consequences; guns run out of ammo. That's realism, even if we're talking about ninja in space and talking squirrels.
Naturalism is something different. There's been a growing movement in anime over the last 20 years to stop using graphic shorthand and to attempt to replicate the real world so it actually feels real, and not so cartoony. So in Ghost in the Shell, for example, you get lens flares and imperfections on the &quot;camera&quot;, even though the whole thing is drawn by hand.
There's a definite group of animators who spend a lot of their time trying to get reality right, and a lot of them drift out of animation into special effects, where some of their best work is invisible to the naked eye. There's also been an entire subgenre of &quot;everyday anime&quot; that regard the real world -- of mundane schools, workplaces and home -- as the last undiscovered country, for a generation of PlayStation geeks who spend their evenings in their bedrooms commanding armies and shooting aliens.
 

Of course, I say that, and then you get stuff like Space Dandy, where the whole cast can get killed in one episode, and then come back in the next as if nothing has happened.
 To what extent, if at all, do you think cultural differences between Japan and western Europe detract from a universal appeal of anime? What would you say to people who haven’t ever seen any anime before to convince them to go along to SLA? 
Certainly, every culture has expectations and traditions, and one that is ten thousand miles away, speaking a different language, is going to be radically different from our own in its attitudes and assumptions. And yes, I think that for some people that is a barrier to universal appeal. But anime's not about universal appeal, it's about the chance to look at the world with very different eyes, just for a couple of hours.
Anime's a whole medium, so just as with something like &quot;Hollywood movies&quot;, there's going to be award-winners and there's going to be bargain bin schlock. There's going to be eternal classics and there's going to be, well, that awful thing last year about the blue Buddhist cat that didn't do anything and then dies. So some of the stuff we're showing is for kids, and some of it's for teenagers, and some of it's for adults.
Anime *can* be childish, but it can also be very thoughtful and philosophical. We've got Giovanni's Island this year, which is supposedly a kids' film but it's based on real events, and highlights ongoing territorial issues in Japan's northernmost islands.
We've also got Appleseed: Alpha, which some might even say is less an animated film than it is an action movie that uses 100 per cent special effects. The actors are motion-captured, the whole thing looks photo-real. I'm sure there are casual passers-by who won't even see it as &quot;drawn.&quot; 
 

We've also got The Wings of Honneamise, which is a beautifully assembled account of a space-race on a world that is not our own. Every single frame of it has been painstakingly put together with an eye to alien detail, from the telegraph poles in the background to the spoons in people's soup. It's an amazing, globally-rated piece of science fiction.
Same goes for Ghost in the Shell, which is 20 years old, but has been beautifully remastered and still holds up as a deeply philosophical enquiry into the human condition in a world where machines do your thinking for you.
I think of it every time Facebook tells me it's time to tell someone else's Facebook page that I wish them a happy birthday. See one of those -- you won't think anime is childish any more.
 Is SLA a good introduction to the genre? 
Yes! Come to SLA and you'll be getting movies at their UK or European premiere, as well as a chance to see some of the classics on a big screen.
 Have you any stories about your time with SLA you'd like to share with us? 
Scotland Loves Anime has spent the last five years pushing Scotland itself at the Japanese guests. We don't just wheel them onto the stage to say thanks, and send them home. They have an interpreter for the whole duration of their stay, which includes sightseeing, and we try and tailor things for them that will make Scotland stick in their mind.

So I made sure that Makoto Shinkai, who is a director obsessed with the minutiae of design, got a book of Rennie Mackintosh images. Masayuki Miyaji, who has an interest in Japan's industrial revolution, went off to New Lanark for the day. Satoshi Nishimura, director of Trigun, took himself off on his own to walk up and down Sauchiehall Street. He came creeping back and asked me if it was true Irn Bru was made from girders.
All the directors also get neckties in the festival director's clan tartan. We like to think that there will be a bunch of bigwigs at a Tokyo party one day, and they'll realise they're all wearing the same tartan and that they've all been invited to Glasgow and had haggis with us.
 What Glasgow event of the festival are you most excited about and why? 
Mizuho Nishikubo, the director of Giovanni's Island, will be speaking in person at the Glasgow Film Theatre. He also directed Musashi: Dream of the Last Samurai, for which I provided the voice of the mad professor, so I am hoping he will not have me executed if he's seen it in English.
 

ANDREW Partridge is Scotland Loves Anime's Festival Director. An expert on the medium, he's also closely involved with its distribution in the UK.
 When we spoke last year you mentioned the mix of your audiences consistently surprised you, that it was not just hardcore fans, males aged 12-25. Was that the case in 2013? 
Good memory there!&nbsp; Yes this continued to surprise me - we had people well outside of the hardcore age category for the Glasgow weekend and beyond last year too - long may it continue as well I hope.&nbsp; We try to provide content that is accessible regardless of your age or knowledge of anime so do come along and give something a shot!
 Do you think/have you tried to make SLA accessible for people with no experience of anime? 
I think that's always our goal - sure you always have some films that are difficult for non-anime people to get (try walking into the third part of Evangelion with no knowledge for example) but every year we aim for over 60 per cent of our line-up to be accessible and I'm pleased to say we have continued to do that.&nbsp; Giovanni's Island, Appleseed Alpha, Ghost in the Shell, Wings of Honneamise and Bayonetta need noanime knowledge to watch and the rest of the films are not designed to be impenetrable either!
 

 Is there much of anime scene here in Glasgow? 
Definitely - ranging from anime clubs at the key universities, several geek shops catering to anime and a whole lot more - if you look carefully you'll see a very noticeable subset of the community in Glasgow do in fact like anime!&nbsp;
Now our hope is they'll spread the word and encourage others to prove how much we love anime in Scotland!
 What are you most looking forward to in the Glasgow event and why? 
For me there's three key things - Mizuho Nishikubo attending the screening of Giovanni's Island on the Sunday, Ghost in the Shell and Wings of Honneamise.&nbsp; The latter two as they're classics in Japanese Sci-Fi that deserve a bit more time out in the light really.&nbsp;
In the case of Giovanni's Island - it's one of these films that deserves to be seen as it covers an important period in history that we're not often taught in the UK.&nbsp; People owe it to themselves to check it out as it's based off the real stories of what happened on the island.

343|||The family of Sauchie schoolgirl Mackenzie Furniss are planning a party after a scan revealed no signs of the neuroblastoma which has blighted her young life twice already. Mackenzie kicks "cancer's butt" for second time - Daily Record Brave schoolgirl Mackenzie Furniss has announced that she has “kicked cancer’s butt for the second time”.
Mackenzie, 10, was given just months to live when her family went into fundraising overdrive last year to get pioneering treatment to save her.
Now a scan has revealed no signs of the neuroblastoma which has blighted her young life twice already.
Her family are planning a party to celebrate Mackenzie coming to the end of her treatment, and the youngster is looking forward to doing all the things girls of her age normally do, like going swimming and hanging out with schoolfriends.
And parents Jason and Kimberley are finally able to plan family holidays and trips to visit relatives with Mackenzie and her little sisters Taylor, seven, and two-year-old Addison.
Mum Kimberley said: “Our focus has been getting Mackenzie healthy again, but now it feels like we can enjoy a bit of normal family life.
“We can’t thank people enough for all their support over the last few years. Words cannot begin to describe how much it has meant to us.”
Mackenzie, from Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when she was just five, and had to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy to battle the cancer. She went into remission in 2011.
But the family was devastated when cancerous tumours were discovered in October 2012. Their only hope was a specialist stem cell transplant which had been carried out by medics at the world renowned Children’s Hospital in Tubingen near Stuttgart, Germany.
While Mackenzie had radiation treatment to shrink the tumours on her skull and her spine, buying her more time, the Furniss’s went into fundraising overdrive to attempt to raise the &pound;300,000 for treatment which could save their girl’s life.
They were around halfway to their total when the Scottish Government stepped in and provided the rest of the money for her medical care. And Mackenzie was able to have a transplant of dad Jason’s stem cells at Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow last November, travelling to Stuttgart for six courses of follow-up treatment after the New Year.
With her long journey over, a series of tests have been carried out which revealed last week that her body shows no signs of the neuroblastoma.
Over the coming year, Mackenzie will be tested every three months to ensure her cancer hasn’t returned. But her parents are hopeful, since an Ayrshire girl who travelled to Germany to get the same treatment has been cancer-free for more than 12 months now.
Vanessa Riddle, 13, suffered the same cancer when she was told that Scots NHS doctors couldn’t do anything more to help her. Fundraising got her to Germany for treatment, and she has remained in remission since her treatment ended in May 2013.
Kimberley, 39, added: “People say they admire our strength, but what else can you do when you’re faced with something like this? You’ve got to fight it and keep going, for your child’s sake.
“Every test and scan is nervewracking and waiting for the results is torture. But we take things one step at a time and we’re over the moon to get the good news we’ve been waiting for.”
Dad Jason, 40, made medical history when he became the first father in Scotland to donate his stem cells to his daughter as part of the experimental haploidentical stem cell transplantation developed by German professor Peter Lang. It was the first time this treatment had been carried out north of the Border, and only the second time in the UK.
Stem cell transplants usually need an identical match from a sibling, but this treatment allows a half-match from one of the patient’s parents. Healthy stem cells were extracted from Jason’s blood and given to Mackenzie, who had intensive chemotherapy to break down her bone marrow, stopping the production of more cancer cells.
The transplanted cells reproduced and populated Mackenzie’s body with healthy cells – creating normal blood, bone marrow and a fully working immune system.###
344|||The Lib Dems have said they will ban coal-fired power plants within a decade if they help form the next government. Lib Dems vow to end coal-fired power generation by 2025 The Lib Dems have said they will ban coal-fired power plants within a decade if they help form the next government.
The Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, told the party's conference in Glasgow coal was the ultimate &quot;climate destroyer&quot;.
If the Lib Dems are in power after the election, electricity generation from coal would be phased out by 2025.
He also announced &pound;100m in immediate funding for the Green Deal scheme to pay for better household insulation and other domestic energy saving measures.
The extra money will be available next month. 
In his speech, Mr Davey defended his party's record in government on the environment and claimed that progress on delivering cleaner energy would be &quot;stopped in its tracks&quot; in the event of a Conservative victory at next year's election.
While he suggested the Conservatives wanted to &quot;frack every square mile of Britain&quot;, he said unequivocal opposition to shale gas exploration was also wrong given the predicted fall in North Sea output and the environmental effects of coal-powered generation.
&quot;The real fossil fuel enemy is coal,&quot; he said.
&quot;Coal is the climate destroyer and that's why I am pleased to announce if the Liberal Democrats are in government we will legislate to ban the generation of electricity from coal from 2025.&quot;
Despite the increasing share of renewables in the UK's energy mix, he acknowledged the phasing out of coal meant the UK would be increasingly reliant on gas &quot;as a bridge to a zero fossil fuel future, at least for the next two or three decades&quot;.
The Lib Dems backed an &quot;evidence-based&quot; approach to shale gas development rather than the &quot;free for all&quot; proposed by their coalition partners. 
&quot;I would far rather use Britain's gas than Putin's gas or even Middle East gas,&quot; he added. &quot;Our own gas is much more secure and, thanks to our tougher environmental regulations and not having to ship it around the world, our own gas is better for the climate too.&quot;###

Sean Barry Moynihan, 30, from Paisley, is alleged to have carried out the attack on a section of the path, near Napier Street, Johnstone, on 2 October.
He is also charged with attacking another woman, with intent to rob, on the same path in Paisley, on 10 July. 
Mr Moynihan made no plea or declaration during an appearance at Paisley Sheriff Court and was remanded in custody.
It is alleged that Mr Moynihan seized the 18-year-old woman by her body, pushed her aside, presented a knife at her, seized her handbag and demanded money.
He is also said to have ordered her to remove her lower clothing, removed her lower clothing and raped her. 
Mr Moynihan is also alleged to have been involved in an earlier attack at a section of cycle path near to Maxwellton Street in Paisley, on 10 July.
It is claimed he seized another woman by the body, demanded money and threatened to stab her, before shaking her and pushing her to the ground with intent to rob her. 
Sheriff James Spy continued the case against Mr Moynihan for further examination.###
346|||A man accused of murdering a 61-year-old woman after pushing her into the River Clyde has been acquitted on the grounds he was insane at the time. Paul Connelly acquitted of murdering Eileen Glassford on grounds of insanity A man accused of murdering a 61-year-old woman after pushing her into the River Clyde has been acquitted on the grounds he was insane at the time. 
Paul Connelly, 49, had been charged with attacking Eileen Glassford, who was from Motherwell, at Uddingston Viaduct in South Lanarkshire on 19 May. 
The Crown accepted his not guilty plea following psychiatric reports.
An order was made to keep Connelly in the State Hospital at Carstairs pending a future hearing.
The 49 year-old was not present during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow. 
His not guilty pleas was entered by his QC Donald Findlay. 
Prosecutor Andrew Brown QC said that would be accepted after reports on Connelly had been provided by psychiatrists. 
Judge Lord Bannatyne formally acquitted him of the murder by reason of insanity. 
The judge imposed an interim compulsion order for Connelly to remain in the State Hospital. 
A further hearing on the case is due to take place in December.###

Five stores a week closed in Scotland in first half of 2014 Five stores a week closed across some of Scotland's largest towns and cities in the first half of this year, a study has found. 
A total of 140 stores brought down the shutters with only 133 new ones opening, a net reduction of seven. 
Aberdeen, Glasgow, Paisley and Perth, however, reported a net increase over the six months. 
Scotland's high streets also performed relatively well compared to other parts of the UK.
Once again, we are seeing a growth in charity shops, coffee houses and discount stores”
The PwC research, compiled by Local Data Company, looked at 500 town centres across the UK. 
Overall, 3,003 outlets closed in a six-month period compared to 2,597 openings, a net reduction of 406 shops. 
In Scotland, Aberdeen and Perth both recorded a net increase of three stores with Glasgow and Paisley reporting a net uplift of one store.
In contrast, Dundee saw a net drop of seven stores while Ayr had a net drop of five and Edinburgh saw a net loss of two stores.
But the research also suggested Scotland's main streets delivered one of the strongest performances compared to other parts of the UK. Only London and the east on England saw positive growth.

The worst-hit areas south of the border were the East Midlands with a net loss of 83 stores; West Midlands with drop of 67 stores; England's North West which lost 81 stores; and the South East reporting a net drop of 69 stores. 
In Scotland, coffee shops, banks, estate agents, sports shops and convenience stores were among those opening the most branches during the first half of 2014. 
The hardest hit retailers included clothing stores, mobile phone shops, pawnbrokers, jewellers and building societies. 
Martin Cowie, private business leader at PwC in Scotland, said: &quot;Once again, we are seeing a growth in charity shops, coffee houses and discount stores. 
&quot;Smaller supermarket convenience stores are also on the rise as major chains shift their focus from larger out-of-town retail units. 
&quot;It's also good to see banks re-opening branches as 'challenger' banks grow and there is a new emphasis on retail offering by some of the established banks. 
&quot;The fallers reflect a spectrum of cases such as Albemarle &amp; Bond where the estate had to be reduced to restore viability through to Blockbuster where the chain's raison d'etre has become obsolete due to technology, which also continues to impact retail service businesses such as travel agents. 
&quot;The fashion sector is also on the back foot, due to too many similar formats and online trends.&quot; 
PwC said the figures suggested digital channels with new mobile technologies and smartphone apps were enjoying the strongest growth. 
&quot;It might not be what customers truly want to see, but it's becoming increasingly likely that the high streets of the future will be based around immediate consumption of food, goods and services or distress or convenience purchases,&quot; Mr Cowie said. ###
348|||Frank Warren is suing former world boxing champion Ricky Burns for about £2m, saying the Scotsman was "tapped up" by rival promoter Eddie Hearn. Ricky Burns: Promoter Frank Warren sues boxer for £2m  Frank Warren is suing former world boxing champion Ricky Burns for about &pound;2m, saying the Scotsman was &quot;tapped up&quot; by rival promoter Eddie Hearn. 
 Burns, 31, told the High Court in London that he pulled out of an agreement with Warren's company because of unpaid fight purses. 
 But Warren said: &quot;He got tapped up. That's the bottom line. 
 &quot;Behind the scenes he got tapped up by another promoter. That's what this is all about and it's very disappointing.&quot; 
 Warren wants the money he says he lost when former WBO lightweight champion Burns signed with Hearn last year. 
&quot;Up until this litigation, I quite liked him. Now I am very disappointed. Very, very disappointed.&quot;
 Burns, from Coatbridge, was under Warren's wing when he became WBO super featherweight champion in 2010. 
 He later moved up to lightweight and took the world champion's belt in that division too. 
 However, the relationship ended after a successful title defence in Glasgow was promoted by Hearn's Matchroom Sport Limited. 
 Burns subsequently signed an exclusive promotional deal with Hearn's company and signed up Alex Morrison as his sole manager. 
 In his High Court claim, Warren says the moves were in breach of a series of binding agreements he had signed with the boxer. 
 A promotional agreement gave his company, W. Promotions Ltd (WPL), exclusive rights to promote Burns' next three fights, he said. 
 Warren also claims a joint management agreement made him co-manager with Morrison, entitling him to a cut of the fighter's payments from 2010 to last year. 
 He says he is due about &pound;90,000 in unpaid manager's commission and that his company is owed &pound;1.8m in lost income. 
 Warren's barrister, Ian Mill QC, told Mr Justice Knowles that, at around the time the agreements were torn up, Burns was already in talks with Hearn. 
 &quot;Documents disclosed by Mr Burns suggest that, at the relevant time, he was engaged in 'conversations' with Eddie Hearn at Matchroom, which led to a 'five-fight deal' with that company,&quot; he said. 
 Warren said he had done what he could to help Burns' career, often to his detriment as a promoter, such as pushing for a fight to be held in Scotland when overseas venues would have paid better. 
 Describing the boxer as having a &quot;massive heart&quot;, Warren added: &quot;Up until this litigation, I quite liked him. Now I am very disappointed. Very, very disappointed.&quot; 
 Burns disputes that Warren provided any more than promotion after 2010 and says the agreement with WPL was cancelled by non-payment of full fight fees. 
 Mark Simpson QC said the joint management agreement was not valid or enforceable and so Burns could not be held to it. 
 Even if he was entitled to some cut, Warren had waived his right by not taking it at the time, he said. 
 The hearing, expected to last several days, continues. ###
349|||Josh Warrington stopped Italy's Davide Dieli in the fourth round to claim the vacant European featherweight title. Josh Warrington stops Davide Dieli to win European title in Leeds  Josh Warrington stopped Italy's Davide Dieli in the fourth round to claim the vacant European featherweight title. 
 Warrington, 23, who also holds the British and Commonwealth belts, secured the biggest victory of his career in front of his home supporters in Leeds. 
 He is now unbeaten in his 19 professional fights and picked up his third belt in 12 months. 
 Dieli, 35, was floored in the fourth round before referee Manuel Oliver Palomo stopped the fight soon after. 
 Veteran Dieli, who had won 15 of his 18 bouts, struggled to keep pace with the Englishman and was overpowered from the start. 
 Making use of multiple combinations, the Leeds man's work rate troubled the challenger, who was knocked down in the fourth and then stopped. 
 Former two-weight world champion  Ricky Burns  made a triumphant debut in the light-welterweight division, securing a 79-71 points win against Frenchman Alexandre Lepelley. 
 Burns, 31, had lost his last two fights and decided to move up to the 140lbs division, but the Scot looked unconvincing at times in the eight-round contest. 
 He dropped his opponent in the opening round but struggled to impose himself and, although he deserved his victory, was far from his best. 
 Burns, fighting outside of Scotland for the first time since November 2011, made a strong start and was the busier fighter in the opening round, landing a couple of crisp jabs before felling Lepelley with a hard right near the bell. 
 Lepelley had his best round in the fourth, landing a hard shot that drew gasps from the crowd, but from then on the bout descended into a cagey scrap, with neither fighter asserting themselves in the closing rounds as Burns gained the 37th victory of his 42-fight career. 
 Earlier in the evening, super-middleweight  Callum Smith,  whose brother Paul suffered a controversial points defeat against Germany's Arthur Abraham in their WBO super-middleweight bout last week, defeated Rafael Sosa Pintos with a third round technical knockout. 
 Derby's  Dave Ryan  claimed the vacant Commonwealth light-welterweight title, after recording a majority points win over Huddersfield's Tyrone Nurse. 
 And Blackpool's  Bryan Rose,  fighting for the first time since losing his light-middleweight world title shot to Demetrius Andrade, recorded a first-round knockout victory over Argentina's Ignacio Lucero Fraga. ###
350|||A man has been charged with murdering a Scottish comedian almost 17 years after he was found dead at his Glasgow home. Graham Fraser charged with murdering comedian Hugh Ferris A man has been charged with murdering a Scottish comedian almost 17 years after he was found dead at his Glasgow home.
Graham Fraser, 52, is alleged to have broken into 58-year-old Hugh Ferris's flat in Pollokshields in December 1997.
It is claimed that Mr Fraser and Donald Murray, who is now dead, attacked the entertainer, robbed him and left him tied up without seeking medical help.
Mr Fraser, who was charged after a cold case review, was not present during the hearing. The case was adjourned.
The indictment claims a chisel was held against Mr Ferris's neck before he was repeatedly punched, his hands and feet bound with electrical cable and his pockets rifled through. 
It is further alleged a telephone cable was pulled from a socket and that no attempt was made to get medical help. 
The murder charge also claims Mr Ferris was then abandoned while he was tied up and unable to get assistance. 
Mr Fraser, from the Govanhill area, was not present during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow. 
His lawyer George Gebbie said defence inquiries were ongoing and asked for a further hearing to be set. 
Judge Lord Bannatyne adjourned the case until next month. 
Mr Fraser was charged after a report was sent to the procurator fiscal in 2012 following a cold case review into Mr Ferris's death. 
Mr Ferris had once been a popular entertainer in Glasgow's pubs and clubs where he was known for telling jokes and his singing. 
Scots actor and close friend Peter Mullan once put up a &pound;5,000 reward for information into his death. 
Mullan had given Mr Ferris a role in his film Orphans, but he died before it was released. ###

352|||NOT many people would take on a 10ft-tall pet that costs more than £25 a day to feed, needs groomed with a diesel-powered pressure washer and has the strength of a small car Scottish horse thought to be tallest in Europe NOT many people would take on a 10ft-tall pet that costs more than &pound;25 a day to feed, needs groomed with a diesel-powered pressure washer and has the strength of a small car. 

And what if the animal was covered in sores, had a leg defect and was more than half a tonne underweight?
“Only a lunatic was going to take him,” said James Mackie, a farmer and fruit and vegetables wholesaler. “He was going for meat, and we negotiated his deadweight price.”

• Keep up to date with all aspects of Scottish life with The Scotsman iPhone app, completely free to download and use.

With a box of fresh veg, a bottle of whisky and &pound;450 cash, the deal was done. And that’s how Lincoln, Europe’s biggest horse, came to live on a farm on the outskirts of Glasgow.
Nine months later, the five-year-old Shire is no longer the emaciated, terrified animal who kicked down a stable door and leapt in fear if a person lifted their hand.
He has made a miraculous recovery, helped by a daily diet of 26lb of carrots, 24 apples, 11lb of spinach, four or five cabbages and the odd snack from Mr Mackie’s staff.
He measures 6ft 10in to the shoulder, but looks set to become the world’s tallest horse when he is fully grown in about two years. The titleholder, a 12-year-old Belgian draught horse named Jake, lives in the United States and is just three-quarters of an inch taller.
Mr Mackie agreed to help save Lincoln after persuasion by fellow farmer and friend Ruth Blair, who cares for rescued racehorses and Shetland ponies.
She called and said: “This horse is with a trader and he’s in a bad way. I would like to rescue him but I need someone to do it with.”
Ms Blair agreed to pay the vet bills if Mr Mackie, who also has two Scottish Clydesdales at his farm in Inchinnan, would provide the care.
“I’ve known Ruth a long time and she knows I’ve got access to lots of fruit and vegetables, and that’s what you need to pour into this horse.
“So I went out to see him and he was pretty gubbed. To be honest, I thought he was too far gone. When he arrived here, even though I’d seen him before, I though, ‘Oh my good lord, what have I done’.”
Mr Mackie kept Lincoln stabled for the first ten days, just feeding him and getting him used to being handled.
He said: “He must have been beaten with a stick in the past, as when you put your hand up he would jump back. When an animal of his size does that it’s pretty scary.
“Lincoln is the biggest horse in Europe and when I put him into the stable he hit his head off the roof. On the second day he kicked down the door.”
Lincoln still has a bit of filling out to do and has not yet reached his full height. Being in the saddle is like riding on a Transit van, according to Mr Mackie.
As well as the effects of ill treatment, Lincoln suffers from a condition called stringhalt that causes one leg to lash out when he walks. A strict exercise routine has helped reduce its severity but it cannot be cured. 
But the transformation in Lincoln has been dramatic, even if he doesn’t realise his own strength.
“He is a friendly big horse but so far has pulled down three fences and lifted the golf buggy I was in off the ground by picking up the back in his teeth,” Mr Mackie said.
Ms Blair added: “He is a fabulous big horse with a kind, docile nature but has a tremendous amount of power in him. He now has a lifetime home.”###
