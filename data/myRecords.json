I know her weight is going to drop dramatically but it’s her spirits I’m worried about.” </p>\n<p>In a text message from her hospital bed, Ruth pled: “Mum, please get me out.”</p>\n<p>Her dad Brian, 64, yesterday wrote to Health Secretary Alex Neil to raise his daughter’s plight.</p>\n<p>In his letter, he said: “I fully accept you cannot get involved in clinical decisions but if she is kept in, there is great risk to her physical and mental health.</p>\n<p>“She needs her job and freedom to keep her healthy and sane.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Retired teacher Eileen and Brian, a helper for people with special needs, have fought a long battle with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over their daughter’s welfare.</p>\n<p>Eileen said: “We’ve been fighting the system for years.

Historic Scotland has already pledged almost half a million pounds for the project, while the Heritage Lottery Fund has ringfenced more than &pound;800,000. Creative Scotland said its grant would “recognise and maintain the historic nature of the A-listed auditorium, protecting its cultural heritage whilst enabling the cinema to increase the diversity of programming”.</p>\n<p>Jane Mayo, chair of Campbeltown Community Business Limited, said: “The redeveloped Picture House will provide the community and visitors with a magnificent historic cinema equipped to modern standards complemented by new facilities. </p>\n<p>“The programme of films and live relays of international quality cultural performances, together with activities based on the heritage of the building and the evolution of cinema, will allow the Picture House truly to become Kintyre’s cultural and entertainment hub.”</p>\n<p>Ms Mayo said the trust was expecting further funding decisions from various bodies, trusts and foundations this year.</p>\n<p>She added: “Detailed design work and tendering will take place between January and July next year, with work on-site starting in September 2015. The complete restoration and redevelopment is scheduled for completion by December 2016.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a long-awaited new centre for children’s literature, earmarked for the childhood home of Peter Pan creator JM Barrie, has been awarded almost &pound;700,000.</p>\n<p>The restoration plan for Moat Brae House in Dumfries, where the author lived between the ages of 13 and 18, would see the property become a flagship attraction for the town, including an adventure garden in the grounds where Barrie played.</p>\n<p>The fundraising campaign was launched three years ago by actress Joanna Lumley, patron of the &pound;4.5m project, due for completion in 2016.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "scot_4291040151.jpg", "caption" : "The" } ] }

I spent a lot of time here with student friends. They were all in Glasgow so I had many a fun night in Glasgow. It's been a while now, probably about ten years ago, but we'd go to The Garage. That was one of the clubs and the students union was always a big one. I doubt I was a hit with the Scottish ladies.&quot;</p>\n<p>Jamie, whose wife Amelia Warner gave birth to their first child in December, wasn't enamoured with his play on the course, despite his film character's reputation for er, swinging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After joking we'd heard he was good at the sport he replied: &quot;Who did you hear that from? This is my first time playing golf here and it's tricky out there. I'm hoping it's going to get easier but the rain is coming tomorrow so I doubt that. I was here in 1999 when Jean van Delvelde was having fun in the burn there and Paul Laurie took it home. I was 17 years old and stood here on the 18th green watching all this happen.&quot;</p>\n<p>The actor who is more brooding than witty, admitted playing golf was bit of respite from his upcoming movie and TV work.</p>\n<p>He said: &quot;This week is a bit of a rest. I've got a lot going on and and have a job coming up in a couple of weeks so probably should be doing some work. I have to do a lot of prep cause it's a job like any other. I do slightly more strenuous things to keep fit but you don't get many tubby golfers. I don't know when I'll next be in Scotland but I always enjoy it. The genes are similar, We probably share some similarities -&nbsp;&nbsp; socially on the drink.&quot;</p>\n<p>He added: &quot;It's been good fun with Bill Murray. He's a legend with a great swing and he can't stay serious for too long and he was great company. It was jokes all round until I was hitting it so badly I couldn't really stand for jokes anymore. I'm now going to have a pint here or get back to St. Andrews where I'm staying to reflect and try to work out how to play golf tomorrow.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bill Murray who couldn't wait to have a bowl of soup with maybe &quot;half a pint of sherry in it&quot; after his round of golf admitted that playing with Jamie wasn't as funny as it could have been.</p>\n<p>He said: &quot;Jamie is kind of the strong silent type and our conversations were interspersed like two amateurs kayaking across the ocean heading in separate directions&nbsp;&nbsp; and getting together back at the tee. He had a little more trouble than I had. He started strong and didn't have a lot of sleep. Because of the new baby he's sleep deprived.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bill who said he'd been on a boat trip round the Isle of May and talked with the seals also revealed he'd been at George Clooney's wedding but hadn't bought him and his new bride a present.</p>\n<p>He said: &quot;It wasn't as momentous for me because I didn't get married although I had a wonderful time and I got moist. They are two wonderful people and very happy. You don't buy them anything as a present.

I'm very much hoping to see some Celtic style items, particularly from the Iona style of metalwork.&quot;</p><p>As one of the largest seaports in Britian, valuers from the hit BBC show are looking forward to seeing items from all around the world.</p><p>They expect to see Kelvingrove flooded with visitors next Thursday when the doors open at 9.30am.</p><p>The city is also renowned for the Scottish School and the Glasgow School, giving experts the chance to see painting, ceramics, furniture, textiles, jewellery, glass and silver - not to mention the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.</p><p>Gordon said: &quot;In Glasgow there was a rich merchant class that made its money and had plenty to spend.</p><p>&quot;Buchanan Street was full of famous jewellers, such as Edwards and Sorleys who made choice items for wealthy customers.</p><p>&quot;I'm intrigued to see what silver items people have hidden away - from jewellery to tea pots. Even if someone is not sure whether their item has any value or not I would still recommend they bring it along for us to look at.&quot;</p><p>Gordon's passion for antiques began at a very early age. His mother had an antiques shop in Dunblane and his summers were spent following his parents as they scoured other shops.</p><p>At the age of 14 he began collecting Wemyss pottery before serving a five-year apprenticeship as an auctioneer in Crieff.</p><p>An opportunity to join Christie's in Glasgow as a silver specialist arose and Gordon rose through the ranks to become Associate Director then Head of the Silver and Jewellery Department in 1990.</p><p>In 1998, Gordon set up his own business buying and selling silver.</p><p>He also advises Scottish museums and institutions on silver and decorative arts.</p><p>The 50-year-old joined the Antiques Roadshow in 2006 and says anticipating the unexpected is what keeps him interested.</p><p>His most memorable find is an enamelled brass cross by one of the Glasgow Girls that appeared at a Roadshow in St Andrews in 2011.</p><p>He said: &quot;It was made for a private family and is a personal religious item so it wasn't of great value but it was a beautiful object, made in the early 20th century and just a real joy to see.&quot;</p><p>Filming for the 37th series of the show will take place next Thursday. The doors will open at 9.30am and close at 4.30pm and entry is free.</p><p>Some of Britain's leading antiques and fine arts specialists will be on hand to offer free advice and valuations to visitors.</p><p>More information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums\" title=\"www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums\">www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/antiquesroadshow\" title=\"www.bbc.co.uk/antiquesroadshow\">www.bbc.co.uk/antiquesroadshow</a></p>", "images" : [ { "name" : "et_25496133.jpg", "caption" : "The Kelvingrove Art Gallery  and Museum welcomed a  massive crowd as it hosted  the Antiques Roadshow and  its experts in 2006" } ] }

We have to take that with us but we need better passing.&quot; </p>\n<p> The only goal came in the sixth minute when Emilio Izaguirre's pass, Commons' dummy and Anthony Stokes' return ball set up the influential playmaker to slam home a precise finish. </p>\n<p> In a first half chock-full of goalmouth incidents, visiting striker Wilson Eduardo hit the crossbar and had a fierce volley well saved, while a dreadful touch from Zagreb keeper Eduardo should have been punished, with Commons and Stokes in close attendance. </p>\n<p> The Croatian champions dominated for long spells after the break but Gordon would not be beaten, thwarting Wilson Eduardo again and pushing away a shot from Marcelo Brozovic. </p>\n<p> &quot;Celtic have had good goalkeepers in the past and that is important,&quot; added Deila. &quot;It is an important place to have good players. </p>\n<p> &quot;He was a prospect to come in before I was the manager but I knew he was a fantastic goalkeeper who was out for a long time with injury. </p>\n<p> &quot;He can't do much better than he has shown. He can work on his kicking but he is a fantastic keeper and very calm.&quot; </p>\n<p> Celtic are on four points in Group D, along with Red Bull Salzburg, and one ahead of Dinamo Zagreb. </p>\n<p> With a double-header against FC Astra, who are yet to get off the mark, to come next, Deila is confident of making progress. </p>\n<p> &quot;We have a good chance of getting the 10 points I think we will need,&quot; he said. </p>\n<p> &quot;It is important for us to test ourselves against good teams but we need to have longer periods like the first half.&quot; </p>\n<p> Visiting head coach Zoran Mamic thought his side deserved to take something from an entertaining fixture. </p>\n<p> &quot;When you see the 90 minutes, we were the better team,&quot; he said. &quot;But football is about goals and we didn't score, so I have to say congratulations to Celtic. </p>\n<p> &quot;In the last game against Astra, we didn't have as many shots on goal but won 5-1. I was sure we were going to score in the second half but it just didn't happen. </p>\n<p> &quot;I'm sure it will be better for us when we play Celtic in Zagreb. I think that could be a decisive game in the group and we showed we have the quality to beat Celtic.&quot; </p>\n<p> Stokes, without a European goal in three years, led the attack for Celtic and his partnership with Commons provided the game with its decisive moment. </p>\n<p> &quot;It was a bit of a graft but we got there in the end with good team work,&quot; said the Irishman. </p>\n<p> &quot;I think I've always had a good understanding with Kris and before the ball even came to him I knew he was going to leave it and it was just a matter of me putting it into the space.&quot; </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__77979404_10293183.jpg", "caption" : "Goalkeepers Eduardo and Craig Gordon shake hands after the game at Celtic Park" }, { "name" : "bbc__77979406_10293177.jpg", "caption" : "Celtic are unbeaten following two games in Group D" } ] }

Nobody would have mistaken it for a Champions League night, but there was an edge to proceedings because the game was so open and so frenetic. </p>\n<p> It was madcap at times. The Keystone Cops with a football at their feet. Ronny Deila will be thrilled with <a href=\"/sport/0/football/29384720\" title=\"Celtic 1-0 Dinamo Zagreb\">the 1-0 victory</a> , but the manner of it might leave him a little cold. Celtic were over-run for pretty much the entirety of the second half. They invited Dinamo on to them and only barely got out alive. </p>\n<p> That was the nuance. The bottom line, however, was a win. And a precious win. </p>\n<p> In the context of their Europa League group, this was a heavyweight night for Deila's team. The fact that it was in jeopardy right to the end only added to the atmosphere, the sense of dread that a draw might be snatched from the jaws of victory - again. </p>\n<p> It was a big win, but hardly a big performance, with one outstanding exception. Craig Gordon was once again the difference, just as he was against Salzburg last month. The Croatians could have been hammering away at his goal for half the night and they might still not have beaten him. </p>\n<p> Gordon is a signing to rank with any of the stellar captures at this club in recent years; an outrageous capture. For the princely sum of zero pounds, Deila has a world-class goalkeeper who is quite obviously back to his best. A colossus, no question. </p>\n<p> This might be the second-rate tournament in Europe but as Celtic came under the cosh amid wave after wave of second-half Dinamo pressure, the tension was unmistakeably first class. Celtic threatened to obliterate their own victory with panicky defending and a wastefulness in possession, but they survived. </p>\n<p> They threatened only fleetingly and then busied themselves with the job of protecting their own goal. They worked hard and they'll have been tired men by the end of it, physically and mentally. </p>\n<p> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/celtic-emotional-ronny-deila-defends-his-methods-1-3559828\"><span class=\"text\">Fish suppers all round, then.</span><span class=\"external-link-icon\">&nbsp;</span></a> </p>\n<p> How we saw only one goal - a clinical thing of beauty orchestrated by Anthony Stokes and Kris Commons - is a question that could puzzle the biggest boffin in the game. Gordon's brilliance explains part of it, but not all of it. Celtic had chances of their own and didn't take them. They weren't in the same league as Dinamo in profligacy terms but they could have scored more. </p>\n<p> It was that kind of night. </p>\n<p> The lone goal went in on nine minutes - a piece of opportunism that wouldn't have been out of place had it settled an illustrious Champions League contest - but chances flowed all night, some nicely carved out, others the product of hapless play from both sides. </p>\n<p> If this was a boxing match then you would say that the pugilists went toe-to-toe for the entire evening, but it was a fight where so many opportunities were created and so few blows were landed. </p>\n<p> Dinamo will go back to Zagreb in a state of utter frustration and confusion. They missed a simple header right in front of goal, they rattled a crossbar, they forced a wonderful flying save from Gordon and then fluffed a glorious one-on-one with the goalkeeper - Gordon again denying them. </p>\n<p> And all that lot was just the work of one man - Wilson Eduardo. </p>\n<p> The visitors had Celtic on the ropes for much of the second half, but pounded away to no avail. It was almost ridiculous. Mountains of possession and territory and no breakthrough.

He is the epitome of composure, a rock in that storm that came blowing Celtic's way in the second half. </p>\n<p> Eduardo was a beaten attacker at the end. So, too, Marcelo Brozevic and El Arabi Hilal Soudani, the pair of them seeing their big moments snuffed out by Gordon's alertness. Deila will like the look of the Europa League table but he won't be fooled by the story behind it. </p>\n<p> Celtic continue to give up way too many chances in these European games - the same sin that cost them their place in the Champions League despite having two cracks at it. </p>\n<p> This was a pleasing win for Deila, though. Flawed and with questions to ponder, but probably his best day yet. </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__77979649_456542540.jpg", "caption" : "Craig Gordon is proving to be a valuable player for Celtic in the Europa League" }, { "name" : "bbc__77979653_10293087.jpg", "caption" : "Gordon saves from Dinamo Zagreb striker Eduardo once again at Celtic Park" }, { "name" : "bbc__77979658_10293071.jpg", "caption" : "The Celtic fans may not have turned out in the same numbers as for a Champions League match but those who did attend witnessed an exciting game" } ] }

Insiders say although the body is lobbying for greater backing for the cultural sector from the Scottish Government, this is unlikely to help deal with the demand from those seeking regular support.</p>\n<p>The current situation means that prestigious events like the Edinburgh International Festival, Glasgow’s annual Celtic Connections, Orkney’s St Magnus Festival and the Hebridean Celtic Festival are in the dark over their level of future support.</p>\n<p>Also affected are the Arches Theatre in Glasgow, the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, Dundee Contemporary Arts centre, Eden Court Theatre in Inverness and Pitlochry Festival Theatre, as well as organisations like Shetland Arts, the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and Hands Up For Trad.</p>\n<p>Creative Scotland’s chief executive Janet Archer, who was appointed last summer, said the assessment process of the 264 applications for regular funding had been the organisation’s “top priority” in recent months.</p>\n<p>She added: “The standard of applications has been extremely high and the quality of thinking, scale of ambition and the creative potential that these demonstrate is impressive. This makes the task of assessment and ultimate decision-making extremely challenging.</p>\n<p>“It is our role to protect the levels of funding currently available to sectors we support. It is also our role to make the case for culture at every given opportunity in order to increase available support in the future.”</p>\n<p>Although Creative Scotland has streamlined its funding programmes from the end of this financial year, just &pound;30m from its &pound;100m budget has been set aside for long-term agreements with the cultural sector, roughly the same as under previous arrangements. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>CURRENT FUNDING DEALS</strong></p>\n<p>Arches Theatre (Glasgow) &pound;358,550</p>\n<p>Celtic Connections (Glasgow) &pound;170,000</p>\n<p>Dundee Rep Theatre &pound;1,085,150</p>\n<p>Edinburgh International Festival &pound;2,317,296</p>\n<p>Edinburgh Festival Fringe &pound;70,000</p>\n<p>Hebridean Celtic Festival &pound;60,000</p>\n<p>Pitlochry Festival Theatre &pound;425,000</p>\n<p>Scottish National Jazz Orchestra &pound;180,500</p>\n<p>Shetland Arts &pound;212,000</p>\n<p>Tramway (Glasgow) &pound;303,000</p>\n<p>Traverse Theatre (Edinburgh) &pound;974,650</p>\n<p>Woodend Barn (Banchory) &pound;69,884</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "scot_2919801725.jpg", "caption" : "The Hebridean Celtic Festival." } ], "relatedStories" : [ { "title" : "Celtic 1-0 Dinamo Zagreb: Celts edge Europa clash", "url" : "http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/celtic-1-0-dinamo-zagreb-celts-edge-europa-clash-1-3561265" } ], "comments" : [ { "userName" : "Hiram Abiff 2", "timeStamp" : "11:39 03/10/2014", "upVote" : 0, "downVote" : 0, "commentBody" : "Why is our money being wasted keeping 'luvvies' in a job ?

In Kris Commons, he has his most reliable match winner.</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Scorer:</strong> Commons (6)</p>\n<p>The playmaker, on his return from injury, plundered the only goal after just six minutes of what proved to be a fraught Europa League tie for the Scottish champions.</p>\n<p>They had to survive a series of nervy moments, mostly in the second half, and were again indebted to the rejuvenated figure of goalkeeper Craig Gordon as they preserved all three points and claimed the initiative at the top of Group D.</p>\n<p>This was still some way short of the performance level which will earn Deila the faith of the Celtic fans, but it displayed a capacity to dig in for victory.</p>\n<p>Celtic Park was intentionally half-empty, with the top tier of the stadium not being used in anticipation of the less than thunderous stampede for tickets. But while the Europa League may be an anti-climax for supporters who have become accustomed to big Champions League nights in Glasgow, those who did turn up managed to create a good atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The mood was certainly enhanced by the flying start to proceedings for Deila’s men. It was a sweetly constructed and superbly finished goal, so typical of the creativity and imagination which Commons so often delivers for Celtic.</p>\n<p>The 31-year-old dummied a pass from Emilio Izaguirre, allowing the ball to run into the path of Anthony Stokes. As Commons peeled off and stole in behind the wrong-footed Dinamo central defenders, Stokes picked him out with a perfectly weighted pass. Striding on to the ball, Commons drilled it low beyond goalkeeper Eduardo’s left hand into the corner of the net.</p>\n<p>With John Guidetti ineligible and Stefan Scepovic injured, it was Stokes who led the line for the home side, while Commons was flanked by Alexandar Tonev and Mubarak Wakaso in the advanced midfield trio.</p>\n<p>It was another opportunity for Tonev to try to make a positive impression, the on-loan Aston Villa winger having been singularly unimpressive in his previous appearances. He at least looked eager to get involved on this occasion and came close to doubling Celtic’s lead when he cut inside from the right and drove a 22-yard shot narrowly wide of Eduardo’s left-hand post.</p>\n<p>Dinamo took time to settle but gradually found some composure and ambition in response to their early setback. Their first opening of the night came in the 18th minute, when Portuguese right-back Ivo Pinto surged forward and delivered a fine cross which his compatriot, Wilson Eduardo, headed over from around eight yards.</p>\n<p>As the game became increasingly open and flowed from end to end, more than the home fans would have liked, Wilson came even closer to an equaliser ten minutes later. He dispossessed Stefan Johansen with a robust challenge and let fly with a dipping shot from 22 yards which smacked off Gordon’s crossbar.</p>\n<p>There was a clear sense that Celtic might need more than one goal to win this contest and they should have made it 2-0 in the 32nd minute. Commons showed great energy and persistence to close down Eduardo inside the penalty area, forcing a mistake from the ’keeper who mishit the ball directly to him. It left Commons with the apparently simple task of squaring the ball to the unmarked Stokes for a tap-in on the edge of the six yard box. But, inexplicably and uncharacteristically, he overhit the pass behind his team-mate, leaving both of them holding their heads in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Dinamo seemed further encouraged by that reprieve and both Pinto and Wilson came close with efforts from distance.</p>\n<p>Tonev tried to get Celtic back on the front foot when he drifted infield again and drove in a low shot which was clutched by Eduardo. Dinamo were soon threatening again, Wilson seizing on a poor attempted clearance from Efe Ambrose and striking a fierce shot which forced Gordon into a fine save.</p>\n<p>The fluid nature of the match was underlined just before half-time when Virgil van Dijk meandered forward to join the Celtic attack and tried his luck from 25 yards, his cleanly struck effort well dealt with by Eduardo.</p>\n<p>Dinamo were almost caught cold right at the start of the second half when a lofted through ball from Commons allowed Johansen to race into the penalty area. Unfortunately for Celtic, the Norwegian midfielder could not get the ball under control properly, allowing Josip Pivaric time to make a crucial covering tackle.</p>\n<p>The home side were struggling to sustain that kind of attacking momentum, while Dinamo looked increasingly dangerous. They should have taken advantage of poor communication in the Celtic ranks in the 54th minute, no-one tracking a move in which El Arabi Soudani set up Wilson with a free shot at goal which he wastefully hit too close to Gordon.</p>\n<p>Celtic looked vulnerable and ever more anxious. They required Gordon to be at his most alert when he plunged low to his right to touch Marcelo Brozovic’s 20-yard shot behind for a corner. In a bid to shore up his team in midfield, Deila responded by withdrawing Commons and bringing on Beram Kayal.</p>\n<p>He was followed into the fray by Leigh Griffiths. In a rare appearance for the striker, his most notable contribution was to hold the ball up in the corner in the closing seconds as Celtic survived a late Dinamo onslaught.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Celtic:</strong> Gordon, Denayer, Ambrose, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Tonev (Berget 88), Johansen, Brown, Wakaso (Griffiths 78), Commons (Kayal 69), Stokes.

FFs listening to the MSSM again it buys Ronnie Time. The only team in Europe, two cups and the league – but Ronnie buys time. What a disgrace of a MSSM. Can they not praise Celtic for a result, really!\n\n Having listened to Super Scoreboard Loyal over the last two nights we have had one night, I repeat one night when \"Super Ally\" was getting slaughtered after the Hibs game. One night for a guy according to the media who has done what he was asked i.e. taken the \"Newco\" up through the leagues. Yes but having spent £70 million; having earned £850,000 per year; having over 1million penny shares; the biggest squad in the country; playing against part time players. But Super Ally\" has achieved his goals.\n\n We are now back to \"The Ronnie Deila Show\", according to the MSSM and Super Scoreboard Loyal. We have as one caller states tonight \"Celtic supporters sticking up for Ally\" and \"Rangers supporters sticking up for Ronnie\". If this is true the MSSM and Super Scoreboard Loyal are totally out of touch with their audience. But then again what's new – when you need callers.\n\n Let's talk \"Ronnie's rotation\". Happens all the time in England when you are in Europe; Two Cups and the League. For Ronnie its taboo. Ronnie has dropped Chris Commons; did Neil Lennon never drop Chris Commons or anyone else? According to Hannah the \"Fitness Guru\" – \"They look fit to me\". Aye right, sitting on your ar*e behind a desk. Would anyone question Wenger, Morhino, and Louis Van Gal on fitness or rotation?\n\n I believe as the new Celtic Manager he is entitled to bring in his new methods and systems – as do all managers. Buy his own players through transfer windows; as for previous managers – that's why they are previous. But not according to the MSSM and Super Scoreboard Loyal. Spin, Spin, Spin.

I spent a lot of time here with student friends. They were all in Glasgow so I had many a fun night in Glasgow. It's been a while now, probably about ten years ago, but we'd go to The Garage. That was one of the clubs and the students union was always a big one. I doubt I was a hit with the Scottish ladies.&quot;</p>\n<p>Jamie, whose wife Amelia Warner gave birth to their first child in December, wasn't enamoured with his play on the course, despite his film character's reputation for er, swinging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After joking we'd heard he was good at the sport he replied: &quot;Who did you hear that from? This is my first time playing golf here and it's tricky out there. I'm hoping it's going to get easier but the rain is coming tomorrow so I doubt that. I was here in 1999 when Jean van Delvelde was having fun in the burn there and Paul Laurie took it home.

I've got a lot going on and and have a job coming up in a couple of weeks so probably should be doing some work. I have to do a lot of prep cause it's a job like any other. I do slightly more strenuous things to keep fit but you don't get many tubby golfers. I don't know when I'll next be in Scotland but I always enjoy it. The genes are similar, We probably share some similarities -&nbsp;&nbsp; socially on the drink.&quot;</p>\n<p>He added: &quot;It's been good fun with Bill Murray. He's a legend with a great swing and he can't stay serious for too long and he was great company. It was jokes all round until I was hitting it so badly I couldn't really stand for jokes anymore. I'm now going to have a pint here or get back to St. Andrews where I'm staying to reflect and try to work out how to play golf tomorrow.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bill Murray who couldn't wait to have a bowl of soup with maybe &quot;half a pint of sherry in it&quot; after his round of golf admitted that playing with Jamie wasn't as funny as it could have been.</p>\n<p>He said: &quot;Jamie is kind of the strong silent type and our conversations were interspersed like two amateurs kayaking across the ocean heading in separate directions&nbsp;&nbsp; and getting together back at the tee.

His written opinion was issued today.</p><p>Whyte, 43, became a director at Rangers in 2011 but it went into administration the following year before being wound up.</p><p>Lord Tyre said: &quot;Immediately upon his appointment as a director or Rangers the respondent (Whyte) caused Rangers to enter into the Ticketus agreement, for the sole or main purpose of facilitating his acquisition of Rangers by providing finance which was lent by Rangers to Wavetower, which in turn used it to repay Rangers' external debt, notably to Lloyds Banking Group.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In effect, a significant proportion to Rangers' prospective income for the next three years was used to pay the bank and thus to fund the respondent's acquisition of the club.&quot;</p><p>&quot;On the basis of the material placed before me, it seems to me that there is a strongly arguable case that this amounted to financial assistance prohibited by section 678 of the Companies Act 2006, and accordingly constituted an offence,&quot; said the judge.</p><p>Lord Tyre added: &quot;In any event I am satisfied that the Ticketus agreement was entered into by Rangers, under the direction of the respondent, for the benefit of the respondent and not the company, and accordingly constituted a deliberate breach of his fiduciary duty as a director.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The fact that this was done, knowingly, in breach of the express terms of the share purchase agreement enhances the reprehensible nature of the respondent's actings,&quot; he said.</p><p>It was argued that Whyte deliberately and dishonestly concealed the Ticketus deal, under which it got the right to sell three years season tickets for &pound;24m, from other board members until its existence was found out by the company's financial controller from an independent source.</p><p>Lord Tyre said: &quot;I am satisfied on the evidence that the allegation of dishonesty is established.&quot;</p><p>Whyte had told the independent board committee at Rangers that funding of the deal would come from him and an email was sent indicating that a British Vigin Island company owned by him, Liberty Capital, was a source of funding, the court was told.</p><p>He said Whyte held no board meetings and provided no information to other directors over the company's financial affairs, making it impossible for them to carry out their own duties as directors.</p><p>It was also alleged that there was a failure by Whyte to exercise rights, granted by Wavetower to Rangers at the time of the share purchase, to receive payment on demand of sums to meet playing squad costs and a sum due to HM Revenue and Customs, dubbed the Small Tax Case.</p><p>Lord Tyre said: &quot;In connection with this aspect there is again an element of dishonesty on the part of the respondent, in that a letter sent on his behalf in January 2012 contained certain untrue statements concerning funds available to Rangers.&quot;</p><p>A further issue was the failure of Rangers under Whyte's ownership to meet its obligations to HMRC over PAYE, national insurance and VAT.</p><p>Lord Tyre said: &quot;Acting to the exclusion of other directors, the respondent caused Rangers to stop making payment when due in respect of these liabilities from September 7 2011.&quot;</p><p>The commercial court judge: &quot;By February 2012, when HMRC presented its petition for an administration order, a sum of around &pound;10.5m had accrued in respect of unpaid tax and unapplied interest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Through his actings at the time of and after acquisition of Rangers, the respondent demonstrated a reckless disregard for the interests of the company to which he owed fiduciary duties,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;His conduct of the business was characterised by dishonesty, in relation to disclosure of the true source of the funds used to purchase the company and repay the bank debt, and by wilful disregard for his duties to the company and to the other members of the board,&quot; said the judge.</p><p>He said that in acquiring Rangers and a subsequent sale of shares in Arsenal &quot;he placed his own interests before those of the company&quot;.</p><p>&quot;He knowingly permitted the company to trade using money owed to HMRC, &quot; said Lord Tyre.</p><p>The judge said that Whyte has had also shown &quot;a wilful disregard&quot; for the duties of a director over record keeping and co-operation with the liquidator of a second company Tixway.</p><p>Lord Tyre said that little was known about Tixway, which went into liquidation in 2012, where Whyte was appointed as a director in 2008 following the ending of a previous seven-year ban as a director.</p><p>&quot;It is clear from Tixway's bank statements that the company held funds. Entries in those statements strongly suggest that some of those funds were applied to meet personal expenditure of the respondent,&quot; he said &quot;Tixway is estimated to have a deficiency of liabilities over assets of around &pound;3m. In the absence of adequate records it is impossible to know how this deficit accumulated,&quot; he said.</p><p>Payments from a bank account included &pound;395,991 to American Express and &pound;414 to a butcher in Grantown on Spey, in Morayshire.</p><p>Lord Tyre said: &quot;In my assessment, the conduct of the respondent in the present case consists of a combination of dishonesty, disregard for the interests of companies to which he owed duties and of the creditors of those companies, use of Crown debts to finance trade, misappropriation of company funds (at least in the case of Tixway) for private purposes, and wilful breach of a director's administrative duties, the effect of all of which is that the case can be regarded as quite out of the ordinary.&quot;</p><p>Whyte, formerly of Castle Grant, Grantown on Spey, and RueDe Tenao, Monaco, was not represented at the hearing where he was banned.

I can barely remember what they were shouting but my only real instinct was to make sure none of the girls in the shops were in danger. That’s what I’m paid for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>“I got quite a hard whack in the legs but I got up and, for some reason, put my top hat back on, as the penny dropped about what was happening.</p>\n<p>“My main memory was these four figures dressed in black emerging from the smoke with balaclavas on, carrying axes, a sledgehammer and what I thought was a baseball bat.</p>\n<p>“My first thought was that I might be able to grab the guy with the baseball bat but when the smoke cleared a bit I could see the guy coming at me actually had an axe - so I thought, ‘I’m not paid enough for this’.</p>\n<p>“I remember thinking they looked like ninjas. With the weapons they had, it could have been a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>Four high-end jewellery shops – Rox, Mappin &amp; Webb, Laing the Jeweller and Lewis Grant – were targeted.</p>\n<p>But the gang only got away with 18 high-end watches from Rox.</p>\n<p>Videos and still photographs posted on Facebook and Twitter show George being clubbed in the back of his knees as he stands guard in the mall.</p>\n<p>He instinctively rises to his feet and, despite his excruciating injuries, is seen staggering after the raiders into the arcade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few seconds later, after the robbers have hit four elite jewellers, George is seen clearly shepherding staff back into their shops and out of danger as axe-wielding robbers emerge from the smoke, screaming that they will kill whoever gets in their way.</p>\n<p>They run past George on their way to Buchanan Street before escaping via a side street to a waiting getaway car.</p>\n<p>George said: “There are normally three guards on shift but that reduces to two at lunchtime. I don’t know if the robbers were aware of this.</p>\n<p>“I was pacing between Buchanan Street and a stairway a few yards inside the arcade when I heard the commotion. I was looking into the arcade and, just as I turned my head back towards Buchanan Street, a guy whacked me on the legs.</p>\n<p>“I honestly don’t remember what the guys were shouting but I think it was threats, from what other people have said.</p>\n<p>“When I hit the deck I was down for a few seconds but my instinct was to get up. I think it’s maybe a Glasgow thing or it’s just survival instinct - I was determined to get up fast before anyone jumped on me and got on top of me.</p>\n<p>“They ran past me towards Rox and I became aware of the smoke going up, so I knew someone had hit the panic button, which was good.</p>\n<p>“I ran in the direction the robbers had gone and I was making towards Rox. The staff there are all female and that might have been in the robbers’ minds.</p>\n<p>“I’m aware that I got as far as Mr Harold and Laings and I was shouting to the staff, “Get inside and lock the f****** door.’</p>\n<p>“I’m a bit embarrassed for the language and I apologise for it but I guess I was under a bit of pressure at the time.</p>\n<p>“At this stage I wasn’t too aware of the pain in my legs but I guess this was just adrenaline. When I saw the guys running back at me and I saw the axe I just wanted to step aside and let them go, which I did. I held my hands up and let them run past me.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>George, who has worked as a security guard at the Argyll Arcade for a year, said the raid showed a mix of professional and amateur touches.</p>\n<p>He said: “They must have planned things quite well because they ran right into Rox. They have a wide open entry there and you can’t just press a button and close the doors.</p>\n<p>“They were in and out inside a minute too, which was incredible speed.</p>\n<p>“But taking a sledgehammer to the window of Mappin and Webb was a waste of time. You could drive a truck at that window and it wouldn’t cave in.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Within two of the robbers fleeing, firefighters were on the scene, followed a few minutes later by police.</p>\n<p>George was taken to the Royal Infirmary, where he was treated for severe bruising to his legs.</p>\n<p>He later attended his GP, who diagnosed that he was suffering from stress relating to his trauma.</p>\n<p>George said: “It seems a bit surreal to be honest and part of me wondered if it was a student prank.”</p>\n<p>He said he will never forget the day as it was his partner Annette Bradshaw’s 53rd birthday.</p>\n<p>He said: “Annette was out in town and she heard that there had been a raid at the Argyll Arcade and she thought she was getting a wind-up.</p>\n<p>“But the videos were all popping up on the internet within five minutes of the raid happening, so she soon realised it was true.</p>\n<p>“She was worried sick and it was quite obvious in the videos that it was me that was being attacked.”</p>\n<p>George, from Springburn, Glasgow, told how he was given a dressing down after a previous theft from a store, after he chased a raider down Buchanan Street.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He said: “It was a smartly dressed guy who snatched a watch from Rox and he just took off and ran down Buchanan Street. There was no way I was catching him but I took after him by instinct.</p>\n<p>“When I got back I get a right talking to, as we’re not insured beyond the boundaries of the Argyll Arcade.”</p>\n<p>You get to know the people to look out for. If someone comes in chewing gum, it’s a red flag right away because this is an old trick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>“People have used this to steal rings by getting a selection out to try on. They will get the gum in their finger and quickly stick a ring to it and conceal it under a desk.</p>\n<p>“That means that if they are searched they won’t have any stolen item on them and an accomplice can come in and remove the ring.”</p>\n<p>George’s normal working day involves starting at 7am, when he dresses in a formal uniform, involving a tailed coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes and top hat.</p>\n<p>The gang, who are still at large, escaped with 18 luxury Hublot and Bell &amp; Ross watches.</p>\n<p>Three Hublots, worth &pound;31,600, were also damaged during the robbery.</p>\n<p>If the windows they targeted had smashed it is thought the haul could have been millions.</p>\n<p>They sped off in a white Volkswagen Golf, later swapped for a Vauxhall Combo van, which joined the M8 bound for Edinburgh.</p>\n<p></p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_JS47879186.jpg", "caption" : "As shoppers were running out the Arcade, George was running in" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47403077.jpg", "caption" : "One of the robbers hits George during the raid" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47879752.jpg", "caption" : "George is taken to hospital for treatment to his severely bruised legs" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47136562-1.jpg", "caption" : "George stands in path of the crooks" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47136562.jpg", "caption" : "The gang are captured on camera with hammer and axe in hand as a cloud of white smoke billows out behind them" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47138968.jpg", "caption" : "A raider is captured leaving the Arcade" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47138951.jpg", "caption" : "Another robber dashes out of the Arcade and onto Buchanan Street" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47137845.jpg", "caption" : "The black-clad robber rushes past shoppers in Glasgow city centre" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47137830.jpg", "caption" : "Axe in hand, he scrapers up the street as shoppers look on" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47137835.jpg", "caption" : "The robber sprints away up a lane near to the Argyll Arcade" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47152234.jpg", "caption" : "Forensic officers search for clues in a nearby lane" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47143115.jpg", "caption" : "Police guard the entrance to Argyll Arcade" } ] }

And, although the United man appeared to come off worse as the two collided, it was the home goalkeeper who had to be replaced at half-time with a suspected fractured toe. </p>\n<p> But before the half ended, the visitors had a lucky break when Magennis outmuscled Callum Morris to reach Eremenko's ball over the top and the forward's chip over the advancing Cierzniak bounced in front of the unguarded goal but kissed the top of the bar. </p>\n<p> Kilmarnock faded after the restart but United were unable to test Conor Brennan, the Northern Ireland Under-21 goalkeeper making his debut from the bench after leaving Leicester City in the summer. </p>\n<p> However, the home side burst back into life when Eremenko flipped the ball neatly over Jaroslaw Fojut's sliding challenge and curled a low cross into the path of Obadeyi, who nutmegged his marker before jabbing past Cierzniak. </p>\n<p> It was Eremenko who also supplied the delivery for the second, Connolly holding off Fojut to head home the Finn's corner. </p>\n<p> United substitute Gary Mackay-Steven sent one effort over while Chris Erskine had a shot beaten away by Brennan. </p>\n<p> However, it was Kilmarnock who came closest to adding to the scoring with Robbie Muirhead's wicked drive being turned over by Cierzniak. </p>\n<p class=\"event\"> <span class=\"event-title\"> </span> <span class=\"event-title\"> <strong>Full Time</strong> </span> Match ends, Kilmarnock 2, Dundee United 0. </p>\n<p class=\"event\"> <span class=\"event-title\"> </span> <span class=\"event-title\"> <strong>Full Time</strong> </span> Second Half ends, Kilmarnock 2, Dundee United 0. </p>\n<p class=\"event\"> <span class=\"event-title\"> <strong>Booking</strong> </span> Mark Connolly (Kilmarnock) is shown the yellow card. </p>\n<p> Ryan Dow (Dundee United) wins a free kick in the defensive half. </p>\n<p> Foul by Mark Connolly (Kilmarnock). </p>\n<p> Corner, Kilmarnock.

I truly hope in another 50 years, our journey will have long been completed and that bad housing and homelessness will be a thing of the past rather than a challenge for our future.”</p>\n<p>Nick spent three years travelling around areas of deprivation all across the UK to create this significant body of work reflecting the distressing reality of housing for many.

Those impressive financial figures could not be manipulated anything but positively by spin doctors of all political hues.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, so early in its rebirth, there are still challenges for Michaelangelo’s to overcome, but if it’s accepting a queue, it’s open to review.</p>\n<p>The interior, after an extensive refit, is smart and contemporary and over time the smell of new paint and sanded wood will give way to the aroma of freshly baked bread and bubbling pasta sauces.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the magnolia walls could do with a splash of colour, a picture here and there to liven up a dining room that, understandably, is still carrying the look of a show home.</p>\n<p>The service was also a little disjointed – it seemed, in part, due to the kitchen being overwhelmed by orders after a steady stream of lunchtime arrivals.</p>\n<p>It left us on the brink of shifting uncomfortably in our&nbsp;seats over the length of the&nbsp;gap between starters and main courses but the food arrived just as we were considering raising a finger to&nbsp;make the point.</p>\n<p>Michaelangelo’s may take another couple of weeks to find its servicing stride but they have already hit the ground running in terms of the quality of the food.</p>\n<p>Fresh, simple ingredients are key – homemade meatballs, potato dumplings, ravioli, pizzas, risottos. There is an impressive selection of meat and fish dishes, although not so many to suggest the chef is on first name terms with his deep freezer.</p>\n<p>Tam and I chopped and changed between the lunchtime and a la carte menus – better together, I suggested, which only brought&nbsp;a scoff, although his demeanour quickly improved&nbsp;with the arrival of the minestrone soup.</p>\n<p>It was piping hot and packed with colour and flavour, with slices of rustic Italian bread to help mop up the thick vegetable broth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My antipasto Italiano came on a wooden serving board and was laden with cured meats, buffalo mozzarella, olives and grilled vegetables and was bursting with taste and smashing value as part of the lunchtime deal.</p>\n<p>The wait for the main courses was worth it as Tam went for the Marcuccio calzoni, named in honour of Michael’s brother (his sister Penne is also well represented on the menu). The calzoni was the size of a hotel pillow, with the dough crispy on top and the perfect chewy texture round the edges and, when punctured, it released a mouthwatering aromatic cloud of Italian meats and cheese.</p>\n<p>My seafood salad was also top notch – simply cooked and presented, packed with the flavours of plump prawns and mussels atop a bed of lettuce with chunks of smoked mackerel and calamari.</p>\n<p>The lunchtime crowd thinning, we held on for a couple of coffees and chewed the cud over our vision of Scotland in another decade’s time.</p>\n<p>Socialist or SNP, independent or still in bed with the rest of the UK, who can tell?</p>\n<p>However, at Michaelangelo’s, you can bet the teething issues and whiff of paint will have long since been replaced by the sweet smell of success.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/gary-ralstons-restaurant-review-locanda-4329804\" target=\"_blank\">Last week, Gary visited Locanda De Gusti, which impressed him with the cuisine and the service</a>. </p>\n<p>* Got a restaurant you want me to review?

Their clients can be assured of a continuation of the high level of service they have come to expect, as well as the opportunity to access the expanded range of legal expertise and advice we offer.</p>\n<p>“Whilst inevitably there will be a need to rationalise, I am confident that the arrangement will provide significant benefits to our staff and client base.</p>\n<p>“Shepherd and Wedderburn has a debt-free balance sheet and a strategy for sustainable growth both in Scotland and across the rest of the UK.</p>\n<p>“The opportunity to add to our excellent client base and secure additional high quality lawyers to bolster our expert teams is ideally timed for our business.

It represents the loss of a long established and very highly regarded Scottish law firm.</p>\n<p>“We are confident however that arrangements are being put in place to ensure that there is as little disruption as possible to the firm’s clients as there is to be a full transfer of business to Shepherd and Wedderburn, one of Scotland’s largest law firms.</p>\n<p>“While all Tods Murray staff will also transfer to Shepherd and Wedderburn, we are very aware that this will be a difficult and uncertain time for everyone affected by today’s announcement. We already have a range of support services available to solicitors for these kinds of situations and we will be offering our help and support to those who need it.”</p>\n<p>She added: “Law firms were hit hard by the recession which, combined with the ongoing, significant changes within the legal services sector, is continuing to have an impact.

It looks like everything has gone very well and it’s really wonderful news. What’s happened here is so exciting because the great unknown has been answered.</p>\n<p>“We’ve finished all the lab research and pre-transplant human research and we’re almost ready to go.</p>\n<p>“The only big issue is we’re short of funds, which we’ve been all the way along.</p>\n<p>“We’re submitting applications for ethics approval in the next few weeks with a view to doing human live transplants in the UK next year. We’ve moved from an atmosphere where people were really quite against this procedure to where people are quite supportive.</p>\n<p>“We have 60 patients on the waiting list for this procedure.”</p>\n<p>Smith also congratulated the Swedish doctors who performed the pioneering operation nine months ago.</p>\n<p>He added: “It would reduce the demand for surrogacy. However, there are still plenty of women who’ll prefer to go down that route and avoid major surgery.</p>\n<p>“But there are many, many women who would prefer to carry a baby themselves.</p>\n<p>“There’s also a bit of a legal minefield around surrogacy and to avoid that and have their own baby is incredibly important for some women.”</p>\n<p>Doctors in Gothenberg used the wombs of six women for the transplant.</p>\n<p>The baby boy was born in perfect health, despite being two months premature.</p>\n<p>His mum was born without a womb. She carried her baby in the womb of a 61-year-old woman. The baby, whose arrival has remained secret until now, was born by Caesarean section.</p>\n<p>Project leader professor Mats Brannstrom, of Gothenburg University, said: “The baby screamed right away and has not required any care other than normal clinical observation at the neonatal unit. He weighed just under 4lb and although this may seem small, it’s normal for a baby so premature.”</p>\n<p>The world’s first womb transplant was in Saudi Arabia in 2000 but the woman’s body rejected it after four months.</p>\n<p></p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_JS47939470.jpg", "caption" : "Surgeon Richard Smith" } ] }

But I am his mother and I will not desert him.”</p>\n<p>Peter, 28, and Derek, 26, were at their mum’s home in Govan, <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow\" target=\"_blank\">Glasgow</a> , when the violent row broke out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>April was staying at a friend’s house on the fateful night of January 3 and the first she knew about it was when she received a frantic call.</p>\n<p>She said: “I’d recently moved into a new flat and my five kids had come to stay for a big family Christmas.</p>\n<p>“After the most amazing few days together, I went to stay over with a friend and left Peter and Derek in my house with Peter’s kids.</p>\n<p>“I got a text from Peter’s girlfriend Ashley early in the evening saying that the kids were tucked up and everyone was heading off to bed.</p>\n<p>“But then at 1.40am, I had a call from my friend screaming down the phone, telling me to get home quickly as Peter and Derek were fighting.</p>\n<p>“My blood ran cold and I jumped in my car and got to the house as quickly as I could.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t have a clue what they would be fighting over – everyone had got on so well over Christmas and New Year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As April raced to the scene, Derek had already lost his fight for life.</p>\n<p>He had been stabbed four times by his brother and suffered 75 injuries.</p>\n<p>A court heard the fatal wound, which caused massive internal bleeding, was to Derek’s abdomen.</p>\n<p>April was joined outside her upper tenement flat by Peter’s partner Ashley Picken, 24, who had taken her children to a family friend’s house nearby after she was woken up by the row.</p>\n<p>April said: “As I looked up, I saw Peter standing at my living room window.</p>\n<p> “Ashley raced upstairs to see if he was OK. But when she came out again, she was white and said, ‘I’m sorry, April, I can’t find a pulse on Derek, he’s dead.’ I just stood there, I couldn’t go up and with those words my heart just shattered into pieces. </p>\n<p>“When Ashley said the word ‘dead’, my knees went from under me.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland\" target=\"_blank\">police</a> arrived, April watched in shock as officers led Peter away in handcuffs, charged with his brother’s murder.</p>\n<p>And the brutal way in which he killed Derek just added to her horror.</p>\n<p>Breaking down in tears, April revealed to the Record that Derek’s throat had been slit and that he had been knifed in the eye, fracturing his eye socket.</p>\n<p>His body was then dragged out of her home and down a set of stairs to the landing.</p>\n<p>April said: “I knew Peter had a bad temper but I never imagined he was capable of something like this.</p>\n<p>“Everything was a blur but the police arrived and then an ambulance.</p>\n<p>“At one point, my grandson turned to me and said, ‘Nana, uncle Derek is in heaven. Daddy killed uncle Derek.</p>\n<p>“I had to go and identify Derek’s body and his handsome face was covered in little cuts.</p>\n<p>“Then I saw his throat had been slit and there was a deep wound from the knife to his eye that had fractured his eye socket – and the brutality of that shocked me even more.</p>\n<p>“When I got back into my house, there were bloody drag marks, where Peter had moved Derek’s body out to the landing.</p>\n<p>“He had been in bed, so was only wearing boxers, and I couldn’t get the image of him lying in the cold on a January night out there alone.</p>\n<p>“The whole thing was surreal. I was devastated but I couldn’t get my head around the fact that Derek was gone because of Peter.”</p>\n<p> Dad-of-two Peter, from Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, denied murdering his brother and claimed dad-of-one Derek had started the fight. </p>\n<p>During the trial at the High Court in Glasgow, jurors heard that on a previous occasion Derek had broken his brother’s jaw.</p>\n<p>Ashley told the court how she was woken up by the sound of the brothers arguing and fighting.</p>\n<p>She told prosecutor Paul Kearney: “I looked out into the hallway and I saw Peter standing over Derek with a knife in his hand hitting Derek.</p>\n<p>“He was hitting Derek in the legs and the side of his body with the knife.</p>\n<p>“Derek was lying down on the floor on his back.”</p>\n<p>Peter didn’t give evidence during the trial.</p>\n<p>But at an earlier police interview, he told detectives: “When we fight, we fight for hours.</p>\n<p>“I can’t remember arguing with him. He’s pure evil when he’s been drinking. He started it.”</p>\n<p>But the jury rejected his claims and last month he was found guilty of murder.</p>\n<p>April, who is also mum to David, 33, Pauline, 31, and Mark, 26, said: “Before the trial, I begged Peter to plead guilty, because I knew he had done it.</p>\n<p>“But because he didn’t, I had to hear all sorts of things in court that I didn’t know – especially his previous convictions.”</p>\n<p>She added: “When they were young, they would fight like normal boys. But as they got older they would still physically fight.</p>\n<p>“They fought growing up, like all boys did, but they were also the best of pals.</p>\n<p>“They were close; they were very alike. They just couldn’t drink together – and that is what happened that night.</p>\n<p>“I think it was the cocktail of alcohol and drugs that I later found out Peter had taken that sent him over the edge and I think he must have just lost it.</p>\n<p>“No one has any idea what they were arguing over. No one can imagine what happened to lead to that.”</p>\n<p>Judge Lady Wolffe will sentence Moore next month.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_brother-slider.jpg", "caption" : "April Moore opens her heart about the agony of Peter (bottom) murdering his brother Derek (top) to death" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47865389.jpg", "caption" : "Family snap: From left Peter, then 8, and Derek, 7, with brother Mark and sister Pauline" }, { "name" : "dr_JS47797245.jpg", "caption" : "April Moore" } ] }

favourites were among 30,000 people pounding the streets for this year’s Bank of Scotland <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/great-scottish-run\" target=\"_blank\">Great Scottish Run</a>.</p>\n<p>Huge crowds gathered to cheer on the athletes in the 10k and half-marathon races through the streets of <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow\" target=\"_blank\">Glasgow</a>.</p>\n<p>South African Stephen Mokoka was first in the 13-mile main event and was cheered over the line at Glasgow Green, clocking up a time of 61 minutes and 25 seconds.</p>\n<p>He said: “I’m really happy about my performance.</p>\n<p>“When I left South Africa I was looking for a time of around 61 minutes, so I’m very happy about the outcome.</p>\n<p>“It’s my second fastest half-marathon time.”</p>\n<p>Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat, 34, won the women’s half-marathon, with a time of 67 minutes 57 seconds.</p>\n<p>She said: “It’s one of the best courses I’ve ever run – flat, with small hills.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to come back to defend my title next year.”</p>\n<p>Scots Hollywood actress Shauna Macdonald, 33, star of Filth and The Descent, and Mr Selfridge actor hubbie Cal MacAninch, 50, were among the famous faces taking part.</p>\n<p>Cal said: “It was great, running through Pollok Park reminded me of being back at school in Glasgow in the 70s.</p>\n<p>“We used to do cross-country running there, we even managed to come third one year and beat the big muscle-bound boys from all the private schools.”</p>\n<p>The couple were joined by <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/emmerdale\" target=\"_blank\">Emmerdale</a> star Chris Chittell, 66, who plays Eric Pollard in the soap and took on the morning 10k.</p>\n<p>He explained: “I’ve been up for the run a couple of times and it’s always fun.</p>\n<p>“It stayed dry for us and we managed to raise some money for Leukaemia And Lymphoma Research, it’s a great cause.”</p>\n<p>Former Commonwealth, World and European champion swimmer Alison Sheppard, 41, swapped the pool for the pavement in the big race.</p>\n<p>She said: “The support around the route was amazing, they were really getting behind everybody.”</p>\n<p>Last year’s half-marathon champion, legendary Kenyan distance runner, <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/haile-gebrsellasie\" target=\"_blank\">Haile Gebrselassie</a>, hoped to take home the title but was forced to drop out through injury.</p>\n<p>The 41-year-old was in contention but stepped off the track around three miles in after suffering an asthma attack.</p>\n<p>He explained: “I was struggling as bit with my breathing.</p>\n<p>“What can you do?”</p>\n<p>Veteran runner Tommy Armstrong took on the 10k challenge for Cancer Research.</p>\n<p>Dressed as clown, the 73-year-old carried a bucket, which was full of donations by the time he reached the finished line.</p>\n<p>He said: “I’ve been doing this every year since 1984.</p>\n<p>“I’ve run it as a marathon and a half-marathon, but now I do the 10k because my knees aren’t as good as they used to be.</p>\n<p>“I always try and come in last because the extra time lets me collect more money in my bucket.”</p>\n<p>The 10k was won by Sean Fontana, of Glasgow’s Victoria Park AAC, in an amazing 31 minutes and three seconds, with the women’s title clinched by Edinburgh Athletic Club’s Laura Dunn in 35 minutes 17 seconds.</p>\n<p>The top prize in the wheelchair race was clinched by Simon Lawson, of Carlisle Tri Club, in 23 minutes 39 seconds, while Jade Jones, of New Marske Harriers AC, bagged the top spot in the ladies’ race, in 29 minutes and 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>The 10k started at George Square and passed landmarks, including the Hydro and Finnieston Crane, while the half-marathon passed through both Pollok and Bellahouston Park.</p>\n<p>Billed as Scotland’s biggest mass participation event, the run also included children’s and family challenges, with more than 3,000 people taking part on Saturday.</p>\n<p>APART from the obvious abject pain, I wasn’t sure what to expect from my first Great Scottish Run half marathon.</p>\n<p>And while I can report that the experience more than delivered on the agony, I would honestly recommend anyone who feels they could run, jog or hobble their way around the 13 mile course to give it a try.</p>\n<p>High on the adrenaline rush of actually competing in a mass spectator event I tore out of the blocks at George Square with thousands of other runners, feeling sure I’d pass defending champion Haile Gebrselassie before reaching the Kingston Bridge.</p>\n<p>The two mile, then three mile markers flew by with barely the need to move out of first gear.</p>\n<p>By four miles things were beginning to feel a little tougher, but as I banked into Pollok Park to the sound of bagpipes, I felt sure this was just a blip before my second wind kicked in.</p>\n<p>At five miles I was gasping for breath, pain shooting through my knees, cramp sending my calfs and thighs into seizure.</p>\n<p>By the time I reached Bellahouston Park I had been reduced to a hobbling wreck, and that pretty much continued until I crossed the finish.</p>\n<p>The thing about the Great Scottish Run however, is that it is much more a celebration of life than anything particularly to do with running.</p>\n<p>To pound through the streets of your home town with thousands of others, many running for charity in honour of dead loved ones, is a special thing.</p>\n<p>Every step of the way the people of Glasgow are there for you, lining each mile of the course to cheer and support with everything they have.</p>\n<p>Many offered drinks, cereal bars and even jelly babies to competitors who looked like they needed a helping hand.</p>\n<p>By the time we reached Glasgow Green I doubt I’d have been able to stagger the final few metres had it not been for the incredible support of the thousands who had turned out on a grey Sunday morning to roar us over the line.</p>\n<p>My finish time was way in excess of my two hour target, but the experience was one I will never forget.</p>\n<p>I doubt I’m the only runner who felt they learned not just a little bit more about themselves, but also about the generous spirit of the people of Glasgow.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_JS47984061.jpg", "caption" : "The

The official said it would not affect the safety of the reactor.</p>\n<p>The ONR regulator made no reference to the new cracks when it announced (1 October) that it was permitting Reactor No 4 at Hunterston-B to return to service on 8 October, after a two-month shutdown estimated to have cost EDF &pound;60m.</p>\n<p>The ONR said it was &quot;satisfied that the licensee's justification to start up the reactor&quot;, and that it could operate for a further three years, documents on its website stated.</p>\n<p>The next inspection at Hunterston-B will take place in 18 months, and EDF has &quot;undertaken to review the inspection requirements&quot;, according to the regulator. </p>\n<p>Acknowledging the future &quot;business risk&quot; for the company in a statement the ONR said: &quot;If [EDF] find cracking that is within the safety case limit, but cannot show that it will remain within the safety case limit over the subsequent operational period - in that case, they would not be able to operate the reactor.&quot;</p>\n<p>The tubular graphite bricks, each about a metre high, moderate nuclear reactions and are essential to safe operation. However, they cannot be replaced. </p>\n<p>Years of neutron irradiation have caused the graphite to shrink, but because the bombardment does not spread evenly through the brick material, the rates of recession are also irregular. This causes tension and eventually cracking.</p>\n<p>Experts at EDF maintain that the new cracks are from an anomalous group of bricks and that the reactors are well within the safety case, which allows for the general cracking of up to 300 bricks (10%) before the limit is breached. </p>\n<p>The rates at Hunterston and its sister station Hinkley-B are between 1-2 %; the reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool are already up to 5%. </p>\n<p>&quot;It is proposed that we carry on using the AGRs as the rate of cracking increases, but there will come a point at which it is necessary to stop,&quot; Dr Poulter told fellow experts. </p>\n<p>But predicting exactly when that will be is not easy. </p>\n<p>EDF employs up to 200 people on its graphite programme dedicated to tackling the problems, and it is already investing &pound;300m per year to keep its nuclear power stations running. </p>\n<p>It's estimated a two-month stoppage alone costs the company about &pound;60m in lost revenue.</p>\n<p>The AGRs generate the lion's share of Britain's nuclear electricity, and keeping them running until the planned new Hinkley C reactor in Somerset is completed in 2023, or later, is a key company objective for EDF. </p>\n<p>&quot;The question is whether it will be financially viable,&quot; says Prof Mummery.</p>\n<p>&quot;The reactors are creaking and showing signs of age. They will need a lot of work and investment to keep particularly the older reactors operating beyond the end of the decade.&quot; </p>\n<p>But EDF were making the best efforts possible, he added.</p>\n<p>The shrinkage issue is not the only problem Britain's AGRs.</p>\n<p>A BBC investigation recently revealed that the graphite bricks were also losing weight due to oxidisation. </p>\n<p>This could impact their long-term safety, especially in the event of a possible ingress of water. </p>\n<p>EDF was granted permission by the regulator in the summer to relax its graphite weight-loss limit at the Dungeness reactor in Kent from 6.2% to 8% after it came close to breaching the original safety margin. </p>\n<p>Hinkley-B and Hunterston-B are also getting close to their higher 15% limits, too. </p>\n<p>The ONR said changes were safe.</p>\n<p>In 2006, both reactors developed cracks in &quot;ageing&quot; boiler tubes&quot;, forcing the operator to reduce temperatures and make modifications to &quot;mitigate&quot; the effect of the &quot;failure&quot;, according to ONR documents. </p>\n<p>Reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool are currently offline after cracks were discovered in the heavy-duty &quot;spines&quot; that support the boilers positioned around the reactors, threatening their stability. </p>\n<p>&quot;This is a big one to sort out,&quot; one senior nuclear industry insider told the BBC on condition of anonymity. </p>\n<p>&quot;These are engineering challenges that must call into question how achievable the life-extension programme is.&quot;</p>\n<p>Britain is struggling to find solutions alone. </p>\n<p>Early nuclear reactors around the world all used graphite, but only the British and the Soviet Union persevered with the technology. </p>\n<p>The USSR developed the RBMK design, which combined graphite with water as a coolant- a technology that went badly wrong at Chernobyl. </p>\n<p>Britain opted for carbon dioxide as its coolant, and that is now causing some of the problems. Only the UK employed this particular solution. </p>\n<p>As one nuclear expert put it: &quot;I wouldn't say EDF can't do it but I wouldn't underestimate the challenges.&quot;</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__77997485_77997484.jpg", "caption" : "AGRs like Hunterston incorporated an array of cylindrical graphite bricks into their cores" }, { "name" : "bbc__77997639_keyway.jpg", "caption" : "The new-style cracks occur in the channel, or keyway, that interlocks bricks" }, { "name" : "bbc__77750344_illustrativeviewfromhinkleypointc-astationandbstationinbackground.jpg", "caption" : "Hinkley Point C should be completed early in the next decade" }, { "name" : "bbc__77997633_77997632.jpg", "caption" : "The nuclear fuel assemblies, also clad in graphite, sit inside the bricks" }, { "name" : "bbc__77997637_brick.jpg", "caption" : "The interior brick material (red) is irradiated more than the outer layers" } ] }

I was the 17s coach, the 20s coach and now I'm the first-team coach. </p>\n<p> &quot;I've got complete faith and belief in them and I think it's the exact same with them towards me.

In the series he gets tips for the pot from tribal cooks in places like Vanuatu in the South Pacific, visits remote corners of Japan and joins isolated communities in Africa and Peru.</p>\n<p>Born in <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow\" target=\"_blank\">Glasgow</a>, Jock grew up in <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ayr\" target=\"_blank\">Ayr</a> and landed his first job in the kitchens at Turnberry before working with top chefs in London to earn his spurs.</p>\n<p>When he was 18, he spent a year working in Australia and fell in love with the country.</p>\n<p>He later returned and established himself as one of the foremost chefs Down Under, starring in MasterChef Australia and opening an acclaimed restaurant in Adelaide focusing on native Australian ingredients.</p>\n<p>Jock, who has two daughters Sofia, eight, and Ava, 13, would spend months in the Outback, camping with Aboriginal tribes to learn their culinary ways. He used that experience to create his restaurant Orana and gastro pub Street ADL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/tv/\" target=\"_blank\">More TV news</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those skills brought him to the attention of the Discovery Channel documentary team who knew he was the right man to take on their missions.</p>\n<p>And although he was reluctant to devote too much time to TV, Jock said he loved the idea because it fitted in with his own cooking philosophies.</p>\n<p>“I first went to Australia because I wanted to try something different.</p>\n<p>“There were huge fusion menus with Japanese, Thai and lots of Asian foods and that was very inspiring.</p>\n<p>“But I started to wonder what Australian cuisine was. So I started digging and that brought me out on this path.</p>\n<p>“I realised I couldn’t make anything unless I understood the people, the culture, the ingredients, the dreaming and the stories that went with it.</p>\n<p>“That is when I went out to the bush to just observe and learn about people and their history.</p>\n<p>“Us Scots have been through several toils and troubles ourselves and I don’t carry the baggage of first settlers, I’m coming at it as a passionate Scotsman who wants to learn from them.”</p>\n<p>Braving the notoriously hostile Australian wilderness, he picked up ingredients, techniques and styles that he later developed into his popular restaurant Orana, serving up dishes such as fermented grey mangrove seeds and marron lobster tails.</p>\n<p>His efforts had not gone unnoticed. While he had never wanted to go down the TV chef route, preferring to stick with his mission to celebrate native ingredients, he did appear on MasterChef Australia.</p>\n<p>And he was the man the Discovery team had in mind to front their new series that combined adventure travelogue and cookery, Nomad Chef.</p>\n<p>Jock explained: “We go out and learn from a community and bring things back to the restaurant to see what we can do with them. It’s gone down really well.”</p>\n<p>The first port of call was the tiny island of Vanuatu, where the women are topless and the only clothing men wear is a horn sheath.</p>\n<p>They cook food using volcanic rocks and unearthed amazing fish and local produce. Jock said he was an awed spectator.</p>\n<p>“None of it was set up, it was very documentary-style. You’re thrown into the deep end and you just have to deal with it. We maintain a huge amount of&nbsp;integrity – it’s not like dressing someone up like some bull TV programme where they make the host wear something daft to patronise these people.</p>\n<p>“We go in there and we don’t patronise them or make fun of them, we just get on with it.”</p>\n<p>His journeys also took Jock to extremes in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.</p>\n<p>“I loved the Faroe Islands, that was incredible. It was like Scotland and they made me feel at home.</p>\n<p>“The landscape was phenomenal and the produce is incredible, like their wonderful langoustines and cod.</p>\n<p>“The Peruvian Amazon was amazing. We cooked alligator and I got stung by an electric eel.</p>\n<p>“It’s got 60 volts – that can kill you. They gave me rubber gloves and said I’d be fine, so we set the bait and caught it.</p>\n<p>“It was massive and really thick, so I’m picking it up by the gullet and it just zapped me. My arm was numb for&nbsp;hours.</p>\n<p>“Everywhere we went was dangerous to some degree. We were in Ethiopia for Christmas and they all chip in to buy a cow and stand around eating it raw. The whole thing. The stomach, the gullet, the hump off its back – the lot.</p>\n<p>“It’s their Christmas day so you can’t be rude. I got really sick after that. But anything I am given I will eat.”</p>\n<p>With the new series launching around the world next week, Jock knows his profile is about to jump.</p>\n<p>No lover of TV fame, he jokes about having his face pixelated for the series but admits he has found the perfect series for his approach to cookery.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about season two if it goes well and if we make sure that we continue with the integrity and the locations are right and it’s something people are interested in.</p>\n<p>“I’d no idea I would end up here. Even if you asked me 15 years ago when I first moved to Australia, I’d never have thought I’d follow the path to all of these places around the world and a television show like this.</p>\n<p>“But there’s never a dull moment, it’s been some journey.”</p>\n<p> <strong>■ Nomad Chef is on Monday, October 13, Quest Channel, 9pm.</strong> </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_Jock-Zonfrillo.jpg", "caption" : "" }, { "name" : "dr_Jock-Zonfrillo.jpg", "caption" : "Chef Jock Zonfillo" } ] }

There has been only one report submitted to the prosecutor fiscal in that period, the outcome of which is, as yet, unknown, although officials believe the laws act as a powerful deterrent.</p>\n<p>Some have expressed frustration at how anti-social behaviour has migrated around the wider park area since the 2011 byelaws covering the loch’s eastern shores came into effect.</p>\n<p>Increasing their influence, according to Fiona Logan, the LLTNPA’s chief executive, will have widespread benefits for visitors, local communities and the economy, </p>\n<p>“The national park is within an hour’s drive of more than 50% of Scotland’s population and this gives us specific problems which - despite our best efforts - have been escalating.</p>\n<p>“The package of measures we are proposing has been developed in conjunction with partners and local communities and reflects our wholesale commitment to dramatically improving the experience of the park for both residents and visitors. </p>\n<p>“Our proposals include significant investment in camping facilities and new byelaws to support more sustainable amounts of camping and to tackle the damage caused by antisocial camping.”</p>\n<p>Under the plans, two new management zones governed by the byelaws would be put in place - the first covering the west of Loch Lomond and the second the wider Trossachs area. The existing zone to the east of Loch Lomond was also be enlarged. </p>\n<p>The LLTNPA says the proposed zones would cover an area of 69.2 square kilometres - the equivalent of 3.75% of the total park area - and ensure only a “minimal impact” on those wishing to wild camp responsibly away from busy roadside locations.</p>\n<p>The move has been welcomed by Police Scotland and residents on the east shore of the famous loch.</p>\n<p>Kevin Lilburn, a Rowardennan resident and chair of the East Loch Lomond Visitor Management Group, said: “Previously we suffered some sort of incident at my home pretty much every weekend in the summer, including litter theft, vandalism and verbal or even physical intimidation. Since the byelaws have been introduced, there have been none. Not one. </p>\n<p>“That speaks for itself and official statistics tell a similar story. We have gone from a situation where my neighbours and I dreaded sunny days to one in which we can relax, enjoy where we live, and happily share the area with responsibly behaved visitors.” </p>\n<p>Chief superintendent Davie Flynn, divisional commander for Police Scotland.said: “We have enjoyed a longstanding positive relationship with LLTNPA and together with other partners continually strive to ensure the visitor experience is as good as it can be and that local communities are free from antisocial behaviour.</p>\n<p>“Police Scotland welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the consultation process around the park authority’s proposals.”</p>\n<p></p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "scot_3541847189.jpg", "caption" : "A young swimmer dives into the water at Loch Lomond.

His partner, Annette Bradshaw, 53, made him see his GP after he went nights without sleeping and showed signs of irritability – which she guessed was post-traumatic stress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>George said: “The robbery happened on the Wednesday and I was in no state to go back in on Thursday and Friday. I wasn’t right when I got home but I couldn’t get a doctor’s appointment until the Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“The doctor signed me off for a fortnight and gave me sleeping pills.

The YMCA’s community manager Darran Gillan, 38, said it had allowed the organisation to help local inner-city youngsters follow their dreams.</p>\n<p>“In the east end of Glasgow – where there is high deprivation and kids are often brought up by their grandparents – money is scarce and spending it on&nbsp;musical instruments, never mind expanding or exploring musical culture, is not a priority,” explained Darran.</p>\n<p>“But regardless of class or education, we all listen to music and this project is bringing people together and giving them opportunities to meet people who can help them to realise their dreams.”</p>\n<p>Here, four of them tell us how much that means…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> <strong>It's a great experience to teach other people</strong> </p>\n<p>TEENAGER Jack Torrance was inspired to give something back after the YMCA helped him follow his DJing dream.</p>\n<p>He decided to start up a recording studio through The Big Music Project to help others who are keen to learn.</p>\n<p>Tollcross lad Jack, 16, said: “When I was in first year I went to a music sound lab and they taught us how to DJ and for two years I played some gigs.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed it and wanted to keep it going but the tutor left so DJing stopped.”</p>\n<p>Jack, who felt DJing was better than just hanging about street corners looking for places to play football with his pals, said: “I was quite gutted when the course ended and spoke to Darran at the YMCA, who suggested we get our&nbsp;own recording studio, which we did for a number of weeks by hooking up with the Think Big project who gave us &pound;300. For stage two to happen, we went to Southampton to work on a three-day residential course.</p>\n<p>“It was a brilliant experience. We got a &pound;2500 grant to allow us to work out what we needed to buy, so we set up a studio with a 32-track recording desk.</p>\n<p>“We’ve now created Tollcross Recordings and have recorded hundred of songs, including one for the Commonwealth Games and an anti-sectarian song.</p>\n<p>“Now I can train kids my own age to do what I did. It’s a great experience to be able to teach.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> <strong>I was heading for the dole now I'm on the radio</strong> </p>\n<p>UNEMPLOYMENT was a very real prospect for Govan lad Holden Hunter after leaving high school.</p>\n<p>Many of his friends were already on the dole after leaving education and failing to secure a job.</p>\n<p>Instead, Holden is getting to do something he loves – and managing to make money in the process.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old got a job as a broadcast assistant at community radio station Sunny G for eight months and the station were so pleased with his contribution that they kept him on.</p>\n<p>The icing on the cake came when Holden attended a Big Music Project Hub at the Tollcross YMCA, who soon introduced him to movers and shakers in the music business.</p>\n<p>Holden said: “I come from a working-class background and was always brought up to get the job done but I really wanted to enjoy what I worked at.</p>\n<p>“I’ve not looked back. It’s been amazing getting to know the people and I’ve now secured my own Saturday show on Sunny G.</p>\n<p>“The Big Music Project Hub acts as a network for me to meet aspiring Scots artists and, as well as giving them exposure, it gives me content for my show.</p>\n<p>“Some of my friends struggle to get into the industry and this is helping them, too.”</p>\n<p>Holden added: “The Big Music Project has offered a lot more new opportunities for me and has helped me to mature and leave some bad things behind.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> <strong>I'm not as shy as I used to be</strong> </p>\n<p>SHY Nicole McCurry has come out of her shell after getting together with The Big Music Project through Tollcross YMCA.</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old has gone from singing in her bedroom to performing live at the Commonwealth Games.</p>\n<p>Nicole began volunteering at the centre, joined the committee and started running her own dance classes.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long before someone at the centre heard her singing and asked her to get more involved.</p>\n<p>Nicole said: “I used to sing in my bedroom and, if I felt brave, I’d post videos of myself on Facebook.</p>\n<p>“At the centre, Keith from East End Beats asked me to sing, then told me they wanted me to do the vocals on the anti-sectarianism song and then on the Commonwealth Games track, Shine, they were doing.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t always confident, I was quite shy. The only people I would really sing to were my sister and my closest friend.</p>\n<p>“The YMCA and The Big Music Project got me to sing live on stage and showed me how to be more confident.</p>\n<p>“Through the Commonwealth Games track, I also met people from places like Ghana and learned so much.</p>\n<p>“I got a job I wanted rather than doing stuff just to get by.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been on the telly, done interviews and even sang on stage with people from the Brit&nbsp;Awards.”</p>\n<p> <strong>Rapping built up my confidence to write lyrics</strong> </p>\n<p>ARRIVING in Glasgow from a troubled home with no running water, electricity or security in Tanzania made Godfrey Shane, 11, an angry and frightened boy.</p>\n<p>But rather than staying resentful about his childhood experiences, he decided to start writing music and rap about his life.</p>\n<p>It has become a roadway to a career that has allowed Godfrey, now 25, to share his stories and encourage other vulnerable young people to express themselves through rap. His project Urban Sound Scotland, a joint venture with his friend John Thompson, 25, of Nigerian and German origin, has just received funding to go into schools and educate children about music and culture as part of the Commonwealth Games legacy in Glasgow.</p>\n<p>Godfrey said: “My parents were arguing and I thought I had caused certain situations to happen. I was a playful kid but when I got back to my house I would be down.”</p>\n<p>He initially rapped along to 50 Cent songs but soon realised he could have more impact by writing his own lyrics.</p>\n<p>He said: “It built my confidence to write my own poems. I now tell others to write down something that lies deep within them and come up with a riff.”</p>\n<p>Godfrey and John are keen to help other kids from ethnic minorities who live in Glasgow to realise their potential and they want to educate others in the east end about different cultures.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t started going into schools yet but we want people to know how accessible everything is here compared to elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“People in Africa don’t have water and electricity and don’t have money to feed their families.</p>\n<p>“We want to share knowledge through rap and education.”</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_The-Big-Music-Project.jpg", "caption" : "The Big Music Project Live in Glasgow" }, { "name" : "dr_JS46414756.jpg", "caption" : "The Big Music Project initiative and how it is benefiting young people in music.

He spent some time in the US - writing widely in the Scottish press about his experiences - and was himself a prolific poet.</p>\n<p>But, it was as a cartoonist that his talent really shone through, particularly following the outbreak of war in 1914.</p>\n<p>Cartoons featured prominently in the popular press, which grew massively in circulation and influence during the war. Newspapers were the internet and television of their age, and would have the only source of news about the war for many. </p>\n<p>Newspapers sold millions of copies a day and cartoons were a key part of the propaganda machine that sought to keep morale high on the home front.</p>\n<p>The quality of Archie's drawing is apparent even to the untrained eye. The detail is extraordinary - faces, helmets, moustaches, uniforms, ships, battlefields, all drawn beautifully and with flair in pen and ink.</p>\n<p>But it's the sophisticated mix of humour, patriotism, despair and outrage that equally strikes a chord, from Santa Claus struggling to make his deliveries to the trenches at Christmas 1915, to frustration at the US for being slow to enter the war, to a very accurate premonition of how Germany would be viewed by the rest of the world if and when it lost the war.</p>\n<p>Another stark drawing, which looks 50 years ahead of its time in style, depicts a dead German soldier lying in a trench.</p>\n<p>Being a journalist myself, I know what it's like to work to tight deadlines and often Archie would have had just a few hours to develop the concept for the cartoon, draw it with absolute precision and file it to his editors.</p>\n<p>To be able to do this with such flair, elegance and sophistication is massively impressive.</p>\n<p>And, it seems my respect for Archie's work is not just family bias.</p>\n<p>Prof Laurence Grove, an expert in the history of cartoons and director of the Stirling Maxwell Centre for the study of text and image at the University of Glasgow, become an instant admirer of my great-great uncle when I showed him a book that had not been seen outside the family for almost 100 years.</p>\n<p>&quot;Archie Gilkison's work is an astounding discovery,&quot; he said. &quot;Through him we live the war first hand.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;He is the only cartoonist I know who evokes an anti-war sentiment during the war itself. He could be for cartooning what Wilfred Owen was for poetry.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a find of international importance. His style is extremely fine and erudite - it has references to textual engravings of the 16th and 17th century, Shakespeare and history, and he throws in a bit of fun - he gives us Nessie as well.</p>\n<p>&quot;Archie does for cartooning what Wilfred Owen did for poetry - he puts it into a different perspective, one which people just didn't get at the time.&quot; </p>\n<p>And why were cartoons important to the war effort?</p>\n<p>&quot;Pictures in general played a huge role in the propaganda machine, with governments sponsoring official images that would help the cause,&quot; Prof Grove explained. </p>\n<p>&quot;On a popular level it was the high circulation illustrated journals - a relatively new phenomenon - that moulded the mind of the public.</p>\n<p>&quot;Here in Britain, cartoons were a key part of the divertissement, providing light entertainment and avoiding the horrors of the war.&quot;</p>\n<p>So Archie, although patriotic, is unusual in that he depicts the darkness of war more honestly than other cartoonists of the time. Underlying his work is criticism, rather than glorification, of battle.</p>\n<p>Prof Grove plans to use Archie's work in a major exhibition on cartoons through the ages to be hosted by the university next year. </p>\n<p>And the cartoons will also now have a permanent home in the archive at the University of Glasgow, Archie's home city.</p>\n<p>Archie would have been so proud, I'm sure, as would my wonderful grandmother, who used to tell me all about her talented uncle when I was a child, though she herself never met him.</p>\n<p>So, what happened to Archie? Ironically, the war that heralded his artistic peak was also his undoing.</p>\n<p>Despite suffering ill-health throughout most of his life, Archie was conscripted to the Royal Scots in October 1916 and sent to training in Berwick.</p>\n<p>A chill he caught developed into pneumonia and he died aged 31 on 2 November of that year. He never made it to the front line.</p>\n<p>His family were devastated, and according to Archie's friend and biographer John Willoughby Bird, the Scottish journalism profession mourned his loss bitterly.</p>\n<p>In a poem to accompany a watercolour he did of a Scottish soldier piping his comrades over the top, Archie wrote: &quot;I heard the piper blaw/Wi my ain een I saw/What ye can never knaw/For I was Fey wha followed.&quot;</p>\n<p>In Scots, &quot;fey&quot; means fated to die, and in these sad lines Archie seems to predict his own fate as well as that of so many of his generation.</p>\n<p>As I get older I become even more fond of Archie and his work - niece to uncle, journalist to journalist. We even worked for some of the same newspapers, a century apart.</p>\n<p>I'm so proud that his beautiful, biting, clever cartoons will live on for generations to come.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__78046253_war005.jpg", "caption" : "Archie Gilkison's World War One cartoons mixed humour and patriotism with despair and outrage" }, { "name" : "bbc__78034206_war002.jpg", "caption" : "These two humorous cartoons were created for Christmas 1915.

That speaks for itself and official statistics tell a similar story.</p>\n<p>&quot;We have gone from a situation where my neighbours and I dreaded sunny days to one in which we can relax, enjoy where we live, and happily share the area with responsibly behaved visitors.&quot;</p>\n<p>The two proposed &quot;management zones&quot;, combined with the existing one at East Loch Lomond, would amount to less than 5% of the 720 square miles the park covers.</p>\n<p>Fiona Logan, chief executive of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority, said the plans being put out for consultation were &quot;unashamedly ambitious&quot;.</p>\n<p>She said: &quot;The park is within an hour's drive of more than 50% of Scotland's population, and this gives us specific problems, which, despite our best efforts, have been escalating.</p>\n<p>&quot;The package of measures we are proposing has been developed in conjunction with partners and local communities and reflects our wholesale commitment to dramatically improving the experience of the Park for both residents and visitors.&quot;</p>\n<p>The &quot;Your Park&quot; consultation will begin on 13 October and run until January.</p>\n<p>The authority is seeking input from &quot;individuals, landowners, businesses, community enterprises and charities&quot; who may be interested in setting up or running new facilities.</p>\n<p>This would be supported by &pound;10m from the park authority, which has already identified potential sites for additional camping, campervans and motor homes.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__78042629_lomond4.jpg", "caption" : "The new bylaws would make it an offence to camp outside authorised sites without a permit" }, { "name" : "bbc__78042631_lomond2.jpg", "caption" : "The park board warned parts of the park are being \"severely damaged\" by anti-social visitors" }, { "name" : "bbc__78042630_lomond1.jpg", "caption" : "Two new management zones are proposed for areas popular with campers" }, { "name" : "bbc__78042628_lomond3.jpg", "caption" : "Bylaws were introduced at East Loch Lomond three years ago" }, { "name" : "bbc__78042632_lochvenacharonceatree170612.jpg", "caption" : "Littering and fire-raising are among the problems faced at over-used loch shores" } ] }

It introduced flights to Scotland the following month.</p>\n<p>But Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said yesterday that the outfit had been unable to make a “positive contribution” to the group and it will stop flying to Manchester at the end of March, with Scottish services ceasing in September.</p>\n<p>Kreeger said: “It was always a huge challenge on behalf of the consumer, as the totally inadequate number of slots made available by the European Commission did not deliver close to BA’s network position, even when supplemented by our own slots to fly between Heathrow and Manchester.</p>\n<p>“The time lag between the takeover of BMI and our entering the market also meant Little Red faced an uphill battle to win recognition and convert customers to its services.”</p>\n<p>The decision was described as “disappointing” by a spokeswoman for Aberdeen Airport, which itself has been put up for sale by owner Heathrow.</p>\n<p>She added: “From what we understand, this decision has been taken as part of a wider review of operations, in which the services hadn’t performed as they were hoping.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to work with the Virgin Atlantic team over the coming year to deliver to their passengers, and everyone using our airport.”</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: “We will of course give Virgin Atlantic Little Red all the support we can during its last year. Edinburgh Airport’s success is built on giving our passengers choice and whilst we’re disappointed to be losing this service, we know that an opportunity still remains. We’re sure that others will be interested in exploring this with us.”</p>\n<p>Figures published in April showed that Virgin Atlantic, in which US carrier Delta has a 49 per cent stake, narrowed its pre-tax losses to &pound;51 million in 2013, from &pound;102m the previous year, and Kreeger said the airline was on track to deliver a profit by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Sir Richard Branson, who owns 51 per cent of the airline he founded in 1984, said: “When the competition authorities allowed British Airways to take over BMI and all of its slots, we feared there was little we could do to challenge BA’s huge domestic and European network built through decades of dominance.</p>\n<p>“To remedy this, we were offered a meagre package of slots on a short-term basis and decided to lease a couple of planes and give it our best shot. The odds were stacked against us and sadly we just couldn’t attract enough corporate business on these routes.”</p>\n<p>Virgin Atlantic insisted that it was committed to its operations in Scotland, with extra flights to be added to its route between Glasgow and Orlando in the summer. It is also introducing a service from Glasgow to Las Vegas next year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "scot_2609860972.jpg", "caption" : "Little Red, Virgin Atlantic's domestic flight service, will be shut down after only two years." } ], "comments" : [ { "userName" : "Russell Mitchell", "timeStamp" : "8:54 07/10/2014", "upVote" : 0, "downVote" : 0, "commentBody" : "It was an Aer Lingus service from Edinburgh so i didnt book with them having been stranded so often by Aer Lingus in its own right.\n Branson is like BMW.

If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.&quot; </p>\n<p> Rangers promise a further announcement &quot;shortly&quot;. </p>\n<p> The Glasgow club, who sit second in the Scottish Championship table, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29180677\">held an open offer to existing shareholders in September, raising &pound;3.13m</a> as they sought to plug a funding gap, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29432736\">including the repayment of loans to shareholders. </a> </p>\n<p> Isle of Man hedge fund Laxey Partners <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29314357\">bought five million extra shares to strengthen its position as the largest shareholder</a> (16.3%). </p>\n<p> Meanwhile, bus tycoon Sandy Easdale <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29340319\">bought 1.2 million shares to take his personal stake to 5.21%,</a> which means that, together with voting rights, he controls 26.15% of the club's shares. </p>\n<p> Ashley declined to buy shares in the open offer, which diluted his stake to 3.69%, but he subsequently bought 4.62 million shares, which was larger than the number he could have bought in the open offer, from investment manager Hargreave Hale, at 20p per share. </p>\n<p> It means that the sports retail entrepreneur, who holds 4% of shares personally on top of the 5% through MASH, is now the second largest shareholder in RIFC behind Laxey. </p>\n<p> Ashley, who recently insisted he will not be selling Newcastle until the end of next season at the earliest, is limited to holding no more than 10% in Rangers by an agreement with the Scottish FA. </p>\n<p> Wallace, who was previously chief operating officer at Manchester City and is also former chief financial officer with IMG and MTV Europe, became Rangers chief executive in November after predecessor Craig Mather departed following supporter protests during a period of financial turmoil. </p>\n<p> Several Rangers fans groups have protested this season about the present regime and have urged the removal of Easdale from the board. </p>\n<p> Meanwhile, South Africa-based businessman Dave King has told BBC Scotland that a newspaper report suggesting that he and other former Rangers directors are involved in a takeover is untrue. </p>\n<p> He also recently told the BBC that he had not been involved in discussions with anyone on the board. </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__78078826_ashley.jpg", "caption" : "Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley" }, { "name" : "bbc__78079032_wallace.jpg", "caption" : "Graham Wallace has been Rangers chief executive since November" }, { "name" : "bbc__78083408_king.jpg", "caption" : "Former Rangers director Dave King says he is not involved in a takeover" } ] }

It does appear he is turning his attention further north, though. He is now the second largest shareholder with just under 9%. He already owns the naming rights to Ibrox and has the deal to sell the shirts. This is Ashley making his move to have influence at boardroom level.&quot;</p>\n<p> Ashley, who is now the second largest shareholder in RIFC behind Laxey Partners who hold 16%, declined to buy shares in the open offer made to existing shareholders last month. </p>\n<p> His stake was then diluted to 3.69%, but the stake he bought from Hargreave Hale, at 20p per share, was larger than the number of shares he could have bought in the open offer. </p>\n<p> The BBC has also learned that during negotiations to provide a loan to the club last month, which would have prevented the need to hold the open offer, Ashley sought control of Rangers' trademark rights. This was declined by the directors, although a company called Rangers Retail Rights Limited was incorporated on 9 September 2014, with Ashley among the three directors. </p>\n<p> If Ashley had participated in the open offer, the club would have received around &pound;840,000, but instead he spent a little more than &pound;850,000 buying Hargreave Hale's shares. The Rangers board are currently trying to raise funds, with RIFC unlikely to be able to pay December's wages. </p>\n<p> Ashley also announced last month that he will not consider selling Newcastle until the end of next season at least. This is expected to remain the case, unless an offer substantially higher than the club's market value is received. </p>\n<p> While the SFA has its own rules on dual ownership, the Premier League in England does not. The Football League does, though, along with Uefa, which means that if Ashley sought to increase his stake further - by challenging the SFA's stance in the courts - and Newcastle were relegated, or both Newcastle and Rangers qualified for Europe in future seasons, he would face further problems. </p>\n<p> If Ashley did seek to raise his stake in Rangers, particularly if he was presented as the only viable option to the club's funding crisis, the SFA board would need to vote on the matter. Ashley is not the sole possible solution, though, since Dave King and investors aligned with the former Rangers director want to invest in RIFC in return for a controlling stake. </p>\n<p> The Englishman already owns the naming rights of Ibrox Stadium and a commercial agreement over the club's retail sales through his Sports Direct company. The Sons of Struth fan group has already raised the prospect of boycotting his stores to try to persuade him to rescind the naming rights agreement. </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__77970959_481285905.jpg", "caption" : "Newcastle owner Mike Ashley already has the naming rights over Ibrox Stadium" } ] }

I want to play at the highest level possible, so if the opportunity came around I would definitely grasp it. It's always in the back of my mind that I'd love to play for Scotland and go further on but I'll just take each game as it comes.&quot;</p>\n<p> But it was not all plain-sailing on the former Glasgow Hawks man's journey to being an Elite Development player. </p>\n<p> &quot;There was a point in my career when I though I wasn't getting a look in,&quot; said Fagerson, capped at U18 and U20 level. </p>\n<p> &quot;I was in a terrible place and was sort of depressed and not happy at all. My mum said: 'why are you depressed? You're giving in; you're letting the people that put you down win'. </p>\n<p> &quot;So I strive by proving people wrong. If you work hard, change your lifestyle and get determined, they've got nothing to come back at you with. </p>\n<p> &quot;If I eat lots of carbohydrates I'll just put the weight on and it's not good weight. Organisation of your meals is important - what you're going to be eating and when you're going to be eating - and recovery after the games is completely crucial.&quot; </p>\n<p>&quot;Our whole aim for the season is to be the first Scottish team to win the competition. Glasgow Warriors, for me, is a big family. Everyone's friends, there's no enemies. The level of professionalism is at that peak and I definitely think this could be the year.&quot;</p>\n<p> Fagerson, a former pupil of the High School of Dundee and Strathallan School, revealed he was &quot;over the moon&quot; to make his Warriors debut. </p>\n<p> And getting the call in the Pro12 took him by surprise, even though it came after a successful run-out for the Glasgow 'A' side versus Edinburgh 'A' in September. </p>\n<p> &quot;When I took that first step onto the pitch I thought 'please don't muck this up',&quot; recalled Fagerson, who Townsend described as &quot;outstanding&quot; against Treviso. </p>\n<p> &quot;But when I made my first tackle and scrum all the nervous energy went away. I got my head down and tried to do my jobs well. </p>\n<p> &quot;Al Kellock was a massive influence on me. He just made sure that if I was nervous or a bit lost he would always help me out. He was absolutely fantastic. </p>\n<p> &quot;There were loads of other individuals - it's a great family atmosphere at Glasgow and everyone put an arm round me and said 'good luck.

He sought solace in statistics, since the home side created a series of chances that were spurned by strikers whose aim and composure was askew. Even so, the reaction of frustrated fans was a reminder that expectations at Celtic do not provide much room for leeway. </p>\n<p> How is the game best surmised? Nobody was wholly surprised that Hamilton won, or that Celtic are still flawed. </p>\n<p> Deila's side lacked ruthlessness up front and remained vulnerable in defence. On the balance of chances created, Celtic ought to have won but then Hamilton can legitimately point out that Dougie Imrie might have scored early on and Louis Longridge could have presented a clear chance to Tony Andreu in the second half rather than shooting wide. </p>\n<p> The outcome confirmed that Hamilton have carried their form, confidence, organisation and self-belief of last season into this campaign, and that Celtic remain a work in progress. </p>\n<p> It is too early for outright condemnation of Deila but he needs a run of results to establish a period of authority. </p>\n<p> Celtic did not appoint the Norwegian to merely repeat the work of Neil Lennon, his predecessor. The club wants to push the limits of what their overall strategy might achieve, so recruited a manager with a reputation for maximising performances and player development. </p>\n<p> It will take time for Deila to implement all of his strategies but there is also an obligation on him to make Celtic capable in the meantime. </p>\n<p> Hamilton's performances are the result of a long and sustained strategy of youth development and playing with a certain style and philosophy. Five of the players who started on Sunday are graduates from the club's youth set up, while two more came on as substitutes. Only three starting players were older than 26. </p>\n<p> Neil and his assistant Frankie McAvoy regularly attend under-20, under-17 and under-15 matches, while Neil started his coaching career at the club with the youth age groups so had worked with many of the players already before he took charge of the first-team. </p>\n<p> When the club won promotion by defeating Hibernian in the play-offs, the message from the executives and directors was clear: the strategy would not change. </p>\n<p> Neil has benefited from this but also his own strongly-held belief that his players are capable of taking the game to any Premiership opponent. </p>\n<p> Hamilton did not stockpile time-served top-flight players during the summer and that was down to the conviction that some of the players approaching their breakthrough into the first-team are talented enough. </p>\n<p> Deila is in a different part of that cycle of development. He wants his team to play a higher tempo pressing game and made some pointed remarks about the fitness of his players and for old habits to be discarded. </p>\n<p> He is right, in the sense that the Scottish game is still too enthralled in the drinking and laddish escapades of previous eras. The benchmark is how the best teams and leagues in Europe are developing players, not fuzzy memories of Kenny Dalglish having liked a black pudding supper on a Friday evening. </p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p>Played</p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>Won</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>Drawn</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>Lost</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>20</p>\n<p>Points</p>\n<p>14</p>\n<p> Nonetheless, Deila will begin to sound like a hollow preacher if his team does not find the means to put together an impressive run. Fans will lose patience, too. He has to combine his medium-term aims and beliefs with a short-term focus on results. </p>\n<p> After all, the two are not mutually exclusive but it might mean sacrificing in the short-term some of his principles to play in a way that better suits his resources. </p>\n<p> Celtic have the resources and players to win the title. Deila has only been in charge since the summer and there is time enough for the team to develop its old habit of being dominant, at least on the domestic stage. </p>\n<p> Even so, Dundee United and Aberdeen are capable of stringing victories together and at this stage it looks as though Hamilton will be able to maintain their form, even if a couple of defeats might disrupt their mood of optimism. </p>\n<p> Hamilton can revel in a period of carefree ambition. Problems have accumulated for Celtic and Deila needs to find solutions quickly, particularly the soundness of his defence and the dynamic among his attacking players. </p>\n<p> He came to Scotland with a low-profile, which means that there was no reputation for him to rely upon in times of scrutiny. He needs to build trust and make a persuasive case that he can construct a period of achievement at Celtic. </p>\n<p> Hamilton's win was a reminder of the worth of continuity but also of a clear-headed and long-term planning. </p>\n<p> Is the Celtic job too big for Deila? It is too early to make a definitive judgement but his team was not too big for Hamilton to bring down. </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "bbc__78049953_10298858.jpg", "caption" : "Ali Crawford (right) scored the only goal at Celtic Park" }, { "name" : "bbc__78049995_10298952.jpg", "caption" : "Celtic spurned several good opportunities to score on Sunday" } ] }

So we thought, let’s ask for specific things that will make it more welcoming. I also think people who want to support victims like the idea of donating something specific rather than cash.”</p>\n<p>The first refuge operated by GWA was a Gorbals flat donated in 1973.</p>\n<p>At the time, it was unfit for human habitation – and Marie believes a negative impression of refuge accommodation may linger today.</p>\n<p>She said: “Obviously, if women are leaving their own homes to come to us you want it to be a pleasant place for them and their children to come into. If it’s a bit of a dump, it can increase the likelihood they may go back.</p>\n<p>“Women do go back, and they do so for different reasons. But you don’t want the reason to be that the flat was a dump.”</p>\n<p>It costs the charity, who maintain four refuges as well as satellite flats across Glasgow, &pound;5500 a year to maintain a flat.</p>\n<p>They accommodate more than 100 women each year.</p>\n<p>The Amazon wish list features items such as cutlery, cooking utensils, crockery, towels, sofa throws, lamps, microwaves, televisions and pictures.</p>\n<p>The charity, who last year supported 1290 women overall, also intend to use it to appeal for Christmas gifts for the people they help.</p>\n<p>Marie added: “At Christmas, we get a lot of donations for children, and not so many for women – and while Christmas is all about children, it’s important women get gifts as well.</p>\n<p>“GWA strive to offer the best possible accommodation that we can afford and families thrive in a comfortable environment, settle in quicker and feel inspired to succeed when they finally gain a home of their own.</p>\n<p>“This itself is our reward for helping women and children escape domestic abuse.”</p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/?ie=UTF8&amp;cid=AO0IROZ0HFY5C\">Click here</a> , or enter margaret@glasgowwomensaid.org.uk in the Amazon wish list search bar to donate something from the list or call 0141 553 2022. </p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_JS48047289.jpg", "caption" : "Marie Farry in one of GWA's refuge flats" } ] }

Whether the bag was a millimetre over the bloody size really didn’t matter.”</p>\n<p>The change in him is seismic. But why? He said: “I think I was young and very driven and some of it was a deliberate business decision. Any publicity was good publicity.</p>\n<p>Generally the bad sold more seats.</p>\n<p>“As a formula, that worked fine for a couple of years but people just see through that after a while.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday he was in Scotland for a Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting, where he joked he is “manifestly unsuitable for employment in any properly functioning industry”.</p>\n<p>He is on a PR drive for the launch of the new winter schedule, <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/glasgow-airport-link-back-track-3809760\" target=\"_blank\">beefing up the routes from Glasgow</a> but having slashed routes in Prestwick.</p>\n<p>He forecasts more of the business routes, to London and Dublin, will go to Glasgow and Prestwick will hold on to its existing international flights and, only just, its survival.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He blames airport passenger duty for strangling Prestwick but insists he could double the 750,000 <br />passengers flowing through it, and allow it to break even, if the tax is devolved and scrapped. He said: “I think that may well happen.</p>\n<p>“One of the great outcomes of the referendum is you frightened the life out of the Westminster establishment.

We won the battle on price but we want to double in size and that’s not going to be done being as cheap as chips.</p>\n<p>“It is going to need the delivery of a really good service, and catering to different sections of the market like business passengers and families.</p>\n<p>“I think I have spent too long being always right. Now I am learning that listening to feedback from customers, generally the critical stuff, is the way to run the business better.“</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_JS48123057.jpg", "caption" : "Michael O'Leary" }, { "name" : "dr_JS48123138.jpg", "caption" : "Michael O'Leary talks to The Record's Annie Brown" } ] }

So it was shocking to see some Scottish councils use information from the electoral roll in a wrongheaded breach of that faith, by <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/alex-salmond-reveals-new-laws-4366097\">pursuing people for historic poll tax debt</a> .</p>\n<p>Glasgow was the hub of the fight against the poll tax – the very first anti-poll tax union were established in Maryhill in April 1987 and the Scottish Anti-Poll Tax Federation were based in Pollok.</p>\n<p>The campaign against it involved people from various political parties and Glasgow showed its strong opposition to this unfair tax by having one of the lowest rates of poll tax collection in the UK.</p>\n<p>Last week, First Minister Alex Salmond announced that legislation would be introduced to stop councils chasing these historic debts. The news is very welcome indeed.</p>\n<p>Sadly – but not surprisingly – the Tories seem to be against these plans.</p>\n<p>I have written to Johann Lamont and requested that Labour back the plan to stop any pursuit of ancient debts. That would send out a powerful signal that Scotland is united – regardless of political party ties – in delivering what is best for the people who live and work in Scotland.</p>\n<p>I wholeheartedly accept the result of the referendum and will be working hard as part of the Scottish Government to ensure that the Westminster party leaders keep to the solemn vow on substantial new powers for the Scottish Parliament.</p>\n<p>For the people who voted No because of this promise of greater powers and for the many people in Glasgow who voted Yes as they wanted Scotland to have the full powers of an independent country, it is vital that this vow is kept.</p>\n<p>A recent poll has shown that 71 per cent of people support control over all tax raised in Scotland, 75 per cent support control over all welfare and benefits, while 65 per cent support control of policy on the state pension.</p>\n<p>There is clearly strong support for extensive new powers. However, we are now seeing Prime Minister David Cameron attempting to backtrack by linking new powers for Scotland to English votes for English laws.</p>\n<p>People in Scotland were clearly promised substantial additional powers by a set timetable by the Westminster parties and the Tories should not be attempting to row back on that vow.</p>\n<p>It is time for the Scottish Parliament to have the powers we need to make Scotland a fairer, more equal country and address the causes of inequality. Cameron made a promise to the Scottish people and he must now honour it.</p>\n<p><strong>LAST WEEK</strong> I had the pleasure of presenting Saltire Awards to pupils at Rosshall Secondary, to recognise their hard work and commitment to volunteering.</p>\n<p>The Saltire Awards allow young people to record the skills, experience and learning they gained through volunteering they have experienced.</p>\n<p>The pupils I met at Rosshall were a great cohort of change-makers. Well done to them all, and to pupils across Glasgow working towards their Saltire Awards.</p>\n<p><strong>FINALLY</strong> , I would like to pay tribute to Alan Henning, the British aid worker who was brutally murdered by ISIL extremists. Alan was a true hero and his family and friends remain in my thoughts and prayers.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_Humza-Yousaf.jpg", "caption" : "Humza Yousaf" } ] }

A prolific author, he has published many non-fiction works that serve as research for his fiction. Writer of Anime: A History and Schoolgirl Milky Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trade, he is also a visiting professor at a university in China.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <strong>Jonathan thanks for taking the time to speak to us. This isn’t your first time at Scotland Loves Anime (SLA)?</strong> </p>\n<p>I've been introducing the films since the first SLA, and chairing the festival jury since the second. I tell the crowd gossip about the films, and I interview the Japanese guests on stage. This means I have to sit through every pre-film advert at the GFT about two dozen times.&nbsp; I earn my money.</p>\n<p> <strong>How, if at all, have you seen the festival change over time?</strong> </p>\n<p>We get a lot of repeat customers, so there are familiar faces now every year. It makes the crowd very friendly and the hecklers very bold. I don't think the festival has changed on the outside, but the organisers have certainly refined their protocols over the years. We have all sorts of systems in place to deal with untalkative guests (this usually involves whisky) or stressful premieres (actually, come to think of it, this also involves whisky).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> <strong>Do you think there has been a changing appreciation or opinion of the medium in Scotland?</strong> </p>\n<p>I think that the Scots are getting used to an annual film festival of Japanese cartoons in their midst, which itself makes anime part of the scenery here. We don't get asked &quot;Anime? What's that?&quot; We get asked &quot;SLA, when's that?&quot; which is a real result.</p>\n<p>I think the real change is outside Scotland, because now there is a palpable sense among, English fans that if you really want to see the new premieres first, you need to be booking yourself some time in Scotland every autumn. We had some people show up from France for one movie a couple of years ago. And there was a nutter who came all the way from Japan.</p>\n<p> <strong>You write non-fiction as part of your research for your fictional works. To what degree do you think anime is grounded in reality?</strong> </p>\n<p>Ooh, well that's a complicated question. Anime is very much grounded in realism, which is to say most of the good stuff sets up rules for the world in which it happens, and then sticks to them. Giant robots are heavy; magic spells have consequences; guns run out of ammo. That's realism, even if we're talking about ninja in space and talking squirrels.</p>\n<p>Naturalism is something different. There's been a growing movement in anime over the last 20 years to stop using graphic shorthand and to attempt to replicate the real world so it actually feels real, and not so cartoony. So in Ghost in the Shell, for example, you get lens flares and imperfections on the &quot;camera&quot;, even though the whole thing is drawn by hand.</p>\n<p>There's a definite group of animators who spend a lot of their time trying to get reality right, and a lot of them drift out of animation into special effects, where some of their best work is invisible to the naked eye. There's also been an entire subgenre of &quot;everyday anime&quot; that regard the real world -- of mundane schools, workplaces and home -- as the last undiscovered country, for a generation of PlayStation geeks who spend their evenings in their bedrooms commanding armies and shooting aliens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, I say that, and then you get stuff like Space Dandy, where the whole cast can get killed in one episode, and then come back in the next as if nothing has happened.</p>\n<p> <strong>To what extent, if at all, do you think cultural differences between Japan and western Europe detract from a universal appeal of anime? What would you say to people who haven’t ever seen any anime before to convince them to go along to SLA?</strong> </p>\n<p>Certainly, every culture has expectations and traditions, and one that is ten thousand miles away, speaking a different language, is going to be radically different from our own in its attitudes and assumptions. And yes, I think that for some people that is a barrier to universal appeal. But anime's not about universal appeal, it's about the chance to look at the world with very different eyes, just for a couple of hours.</p>\n<p>Anime's a whole medium, so just as with something like &quot;Hollywood movies&quot;, there's going to be award-winners and there's going to be bargain bin schlock. There's going to be eternal classics and there's going to be, well, that awful thing last year about the blue Buddhist cat that didn't do anything and then dies. So some of the stuff we're showing is for kids, and some of it's for teenagers, and some of it's for adults.</p>\n<p>Anime *can* be childish, but it can also be very thoughtful and philosophical. We've got Giovanni's Island this year, which is supposedly a kids' film but it's based on real events, and highlights ongoing territorial issues in Japan's northernmost islands.</p>\n<p>We've also got Appleseed: Alpha, which some might even say is less an animated film than it is an action movie that uses 100 per cent special effects. The actors are motion-captured, the whole thing looks photo-real. I'm sure there are casual passers-by who won't even see it as &quot;drawn.&quot; </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We've also got The Wings of Honneamise, which is a beautifully assembled account of a space-race on a world that is not our own. Every single frame of it has been painstakingly put together with an eye to alien detail, from the telegraph poles in the background to the spoons in people's soup. It's an amazing, globally-rated piece of science fiction.</p>\n<p>Same goes for Ghost in the Shell, which is 20 years old, but has been beautifully remastered and still holds up as a deeply philosophical enquiry into the human condition in a world where machines do your thinking for you.</p>\n<p>I think of it every time Facebook tells me it's time to tell someone else's Facebook page that I wish them a happy birthday. See one of those -- you won't think anime is childish any more.</p>\n<p> <strong>Is SLA a good introduction to the genre?</strong> </p>\n<p>Yes! Come to SLA and you'll be getting movies at their UK or European premiere, as well as a chance to see some of the classics on a big screen.</p>\n<p> <strong>Have you any stories about your time with SLA you'd like to share with us?</strong> </p>\n<p>Scotland Loves Anime has spent the last five years pushing Scotland itself at the Japanese guests. We don't just wheel them onto the stage to say thanks, and send them home. They have an interpreter for the whole duration of their stay, which includes sightseeing, and we try and tailor things for them that will make Scotland stick in their mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So I made sure that Makoto Shinkai, who is a director obsessed with the minutiae of design, got a book of Rennie Mackintosh images. Masayuki Miyaji, who has an interest in Japan's industrial revolution, went off to New Lanark for the day. Satoshi Nishimura, director of Trigun, took himself off on his own to walk up and down Sauchiehall Street. He came creeping back and asked me if it was true Irn Bru was made from girders.</p>\n<p>All the directors also get neckties in the festival director's clan tartan. We like to think that there will be a bunch of bigwigs at a Tokyo party one day, and they'll realise they're all wearing the same tartan and that they've all been invited to Glasgow and had haggis with us.</p>\n<p> <strong>What Glasgow event of the festival are you most excited about and why?</strong> </p>\n<p>Mizuho Nishikubo, the director of Giovanni's Island, will be speaking in person at the Glasgow Film Theatre. He also directed Musashi: Dream of the Last Samurai, for which I provided the voice of the mad professor, so I am hoping he will not have me executed if he's seen it in English.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ANDREW Partridge is Scotland Loves Anime's Festival Director. An expert on the medium, he's also closely involved with its distribution in the UK.</p>\n<p> <strong>When we spoke last year you mentioned the mix of your audiences consistently surprised you, that it was not just hardcore fans, males aged 12-25. Was that the case in 2013?</strong> </p>\n<p>Good memory there!&nbsp; Yes this continued to surprise me - we had people well outside of the hardcore age category for the Glasgow weekend and beyond last year too - long may it continue as well I hope.&nbsp; We try to provide content that is accessible regardless of your age or knowledge of anime so do come along and give something a shot!</p>\n<p> <strong>Do you think/have you tried to make SLA accessible for people with no experience of anime?</strong> </p>\n<p>I think that's always our goal - sure you always have some films that are difficult for non-anime people to get (try walking into the third part of Evangelion with no knowledge for example) but every year we aim for over 60 per cent of our line-up to be accessible and I'm pleased to say we have continued to do that.&nbsp; Giovanni's Island, Appleseed Alpha, Ghost in the Shell, Wings of Honneamise and Bayonetta need noanime knowledge to watch and the rest of the films are not designed to be impenetrable either!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> <strong>Is there much of anime scene here in Glasgow?</strong> </p>\n<p>Definitely - ranging from anime clubs at the key universities, several geek shops catering to anime and a whole lot more - if you look carefully you'll see a very noticeable subset of the community in Glasgow do in fact like anime!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now our hope is they'll spread the word and encourage others to prove how much we love anime in Scotland!</p>\n<p> <strong>What are you most looking forward to in the Glasgow event and why?</strong> </p>\n<p>For me there's three key things - Mizuho Nishikubo attending the screening of Giovanni's Island on the Sunday, Ghost in the Shell and Wings of Honneamise.&nbsp; The latter two as they're classics in Japanese Sci-Fi that deserve a bit more time out in the light really.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the case of Giovanni's Island - it's one of these films that deserves to be seen as it covers an important period in history that we're not often taught in the UK.&nbsp; People owe it to themselves to check it out as it's based off the real stories of what happened on the island.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.lovesanimation.com/\">Click here to visit the Scotland Loves Anime</a> website for full listings. </p>\n<p>The festival runs Friday, October 10 to Sunday, October 12 in Glasgow and Monday, October 13 to Sunday, October 19 in Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_JS48055099.jpg", "caption" : "A scene from Battle of the Gods" }, { "name" : "dr_JS48055094.jpg", "caption" : "Anime expert Jonathan Clements" }, { "name" : "dr_JS48056080.jpg", "caption" : "A scene from Ghost in the Shell" }, { "name" : "dr_Screen-Shot-2014-10-08-at-145026.png", "caption" : "A scene from Appleseed Alpha" }, { "name" : "dr_JS48056896.png", "caption" : "Scotland Loves Anime festival director Andrew Partridge" }, { "name" : "dr_JS48055097.jpg", "caption" : "A scene from Giovanni's Island" } ] }

Words cannot begin to describe how much it has meant to us.”</p>\n<p>Mackenzie, from Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when she was just five, and had to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy to battle the cancer. She went into remission in 2011.</p>\n<p>But the family was devastated when cancerous tumours were discovered in October 2012. Their only hope was a specialist stem cell transplant which had been carried out by medics at the world renowned Children’s Hospital in Tubingen near Stuttgart, Germany.</p>\n<p>While Mackenzie had radiation treatment to shrink the tumours on her skull and her spine, buying her more time, the Furniss’s went into fundraising overdrive to attempt to raise the &pound;300,000 for treatment which could save their girl’s life.</p>\n<p>They were around halfway to their total when the Scottish Government stepped in and provided the rest of the money for her medical care. And Mackenzie was able to have a transplant of dad Jason’s stem cells at Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow last November, travelling to Stuttgart for six courses of follow-up treatment after the New Year.</p>\n<p>With her long journey over, a series of tests have been carried out which revealed last week that her body shows no signs of the neuroblastoma.</p>\n<p>Over the coming year, Mackenzie will be tested every three months to ensure her cancer hasn’t returned. But her parents are hopeful, since an Ayrshire girl who travelled to Germany to get the same treatment has been cancer-free for more than 12 months now.</p>\n<p>Vanessa Riddle, 13, suffered the same cancer when she was told that Scots NHS doctors couldn’t do anything more to help her. Fundraising got her to Germany for treatment, and she has remained in remission since her treatment ended in May 2013.</p>\n<p>Kimberley, 39, added: “People say they admire our strength, but what else can you do when you’re faced with something like this? You’ve got to fight it and keep going, for your child’s sake.</p>\n<p>“Every test and scan is nervewracking and waiting for the results is torture. But we take things one step at a time and we’re over the moon to get the good news we’ve been waiting for.”</p>\n<p>Dad Jason, 40, made medical history when he became the first father in Scotland to donate his stem cells to his daughter as part of the experimental haploidentical stem cell transplantation developed by German professor Peter Lang. It was the first time this treatment had been carried out north of the Border, and only the second time in the UK.</p>\n<p>Stem cell transplants usually need an identical match from a sibling, but this treatment allows a half-match from one of the patient’s parents. Healthy stem cells were extracted from Jason’s blood and given to Mackenzie, who had intensive chemotherapy to break down her bone marrow, stopping the production of more cancer cells.</p>\n<p>The transplanted cells reproduced and populated Mackenzie’s body with healthy cells – creating normal blood, bone marrow and a fully working immune system.</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "dr_mackenzie.jpg", "caption" : "MacKenzie Furniss" } ] }

That's the bottom line. </p>\n<p> &quot;Behind the scenes he got tapped up by another promoter.

Now I am very disappointed. Very, very disappointed.&quot;</p>\n<p> Burns, from Coatbridge, was under Warren's wing when he became WBO super featherweight champion in 2010. </p>\n<p> He later moved up to lightweight and took the world champion's belt in that division too. </p>\n<p> However, the relationship ended after a successful title defence in Glasgow was promoted by Hearn's Matchroom Sport Limited. </p>\n<p> Burns subsequently signed an exclusive promotional deal with Hearn's company and signed up Alex Morrison as his sole manager. </p>\n<p> In his High Court claim, Warren says the moves were in breach of a series of binding agreements he had signed with the boxer. </p>\n<p> A promotional agreement gave his company, W. Promotions Ltd (WPL), exclusive rights to promote Burns' next three fights, he said. </p>\n<p> Warren also claims a joint management agreement made him co-manager with Morrison, entitling him to a cut of the fighter's payments from 2010 to last year. </p>\n<p> He says he is due about &pound;90,000 in unpaid manager's commission and that his company is owed &pound;1.8m in lost income. </p>\n<p> Warren's barrister, Ian Mill QC, told Mr Justice Knowles that, at around the time the agreements were torn up, Burns was already in talks with Hearn. </p>\n<p> &quot;Documents disclosed by Mr Burns suggest that, at the relevant time, he was engaged in 'conversations' with Eddie Hearn at Matchroom, which led to a 'five-fight deal' with that company,&quot; he said. </p>\n<p> Warren said he had done what he could to help Burns' career, often to his detriment as a promoter, such as pushing for a fight to be held in Scotland when overseas venues would have paid better. </p>\n<p> Describing the boxer as having a &quot;massive heart&quot;, Warren added: &quot;Up until this litigation, I quite liked him.

And that’s how Lincoln, Europe’s biggest horse, came to live on a farm on the outskirts of Glasgow.</p>\n<p>Nine months later, the five-year-old Shire is no longer the emaciated, terrified animal who kicked down a stable door and leapt in fear if a person lifted their hand.</p>\n<p>He has made a miraculous recovery, helped by a daily diet of 26lb of carrots, 24 apples, 11lb of spinach, four or five cabbages and the odd snack from Mr Mackie’s staff.</p>\n<p>He measures 6ft 10in to the shoulder, but looks set to become the world’s tallest horse when he is fully grown in about two years. The titleholder, a 12-year-old Belgian draught horse named Jake, lives in the United States and is just three-quarters of an inch taller.</p>\n<p>Mr Mackie agreed to help save Lincoln after persuasion by fellow farmer and friend Ruth Blair, who cares for rescued racehorses and Shetland ponies.</p>\n<p>She called and said: “This horse is with a trader and he’s in a bad way. I would like to rescue him but I need someone to do it with.”</p>\n<p>Ms Blair agreed to pay the vet bills if Mr Mackie, who also has two Scottish Clydesdales at his farm in Inchinnan, would provide the care.</p>\n<p>“I’ve known Ruth a long time and she knows I’ve got access to lots of fruit and vegetables, and that’s what you need to pour into this horse.</p>\n<p>“So I went out to see him and he was pretty gubbed. To be honest, I thought he was too far gone. When he arrived here, even though I’d seen him before, I though, ‘Oh my good lord, what have I done’.”</p>\n<p>Mr Mackie kept Lincoln stabled for the first ten days, just feeding him and getting him used to being handled.</p>\n<p>He said: “He must have been beaten with a stick in the past, as when you put your hand up he would jump back. When an animal of his size does that it’s pretty scary.</p>\n<p>“Lincoln is the biggest horse in Europe and when I put him into the stable he hit his head off the roof. On the second day he kicked down the door.”</p>\n<p>Lincoln still has a bit of filling out to do and has not yet reached his full height. Being in the saddle is like riding on a Transit van, according to Mr Mackie.</p>\n<p>As well as the effects of ill treatment, Lincoln suffers from a condition called stringhalt that causes one leg to lash out when he walks. A strict exercise routine has helped reduce its severity but it cannot be cured. </p>\n<p>But the transformation in Lincoln has been dramatic, even if he doesn’t realise his own strength.</p>\n<p>“He is a friendly big horse but so far has pulled down three fences and lifted the golf buggy I was in off the ground by picking up the back in his teeth,” Mr Mackie said.</p>\n<p>Ms Blair added: “He is a fabulous big horse with a kind, docile nature but has a tremendous amount of power in him. He now has a lifetime home.”</p>\n", "images" : [ { "name" : "scot_4260687586.jpg", "caption" : "Lincoln at Tannoch Stables near Cumbernauld." } ], "comments" : [ { "userName" : "tested", "timeStamp" : "7:54 09/10/2014", "upVote" : 1, "downVote" : 0, "commentBody" : "This horse was obviously abused.
