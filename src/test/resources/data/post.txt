The Information Retrieval Group led by Professor Keith van Rijsbergen has a vigorous programme of research, based on both theory and experiment, aimed at developing novel, effective, and efficient retrieval approaches for all types of information. The group plays a leading role in the international information retrieval community and has set trends in many aspects of IR research. The IR group of Glasgow is one of the oldest and major information retrieval research centres in the world.

The group, part of the Department of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, has a long and strong research history in a wide area of information retrieval research from theoretical modelling of the retrieval process to large-scale text retrieval systems building and to the interactive evaluation of multimedia information retrieval systems. The group's interests also include areas such as large-scale and high performance text retrieval, Web information retrieval, Distributed and Peer-to-Peer retrieval, Intranet/Enterprise and Blog search, multilingual retrieval, and the development of novel adaptive interaction techniques. Our research preserves a strong emphasis on theoretically-driven, still practical solutions for large-scale document collections. The group maintains strong links with researchers in Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction, as well as with industry through knowledge and technology transfer. Members of the group have also been extensively involved in organising major conferences, workshops and summer schools in the area of information retrieval.

Forthcoming Events:ECIR 2011 Workshop on Information Management and Retrieval in Mobile Adhoc Societies (MASoc 2011) 
This workshop focuses on Information Retrieval (IR) challenges for dynamic, mobile adhoc societies (MASocs). Current social networks are based on the typical web paradigm where support from fixed infrastructures is required, and therefore interactions are largely based on users' permanent information needs and characteristics. On the other hand, due to the increasing popularity and technological advances in mobile devices (increased dependability, connectivity, user-friendliness, battery life) we can envision a new type of decentralised social network able to directly address ephemeral information needs and interactions. IR and related technologies will be at the core of this new paradigm due to its inherent lack of fixed points of reference.

ECIR 2011 Workshop on Diversity in Document Retrieval (DDR 2011)
When an ambiguous query is received, a sensible approach is for the information retrieval (IR) system to diversify the results retrieved for this query, in the hope that at least one of the interpretations of the query intent will satisfy the user. Diversity is an increasingly important topic, of interest to both academic researchers (such as participants in the TREC Web and Blog track diversity tasks), as well as to search engines professionals. In this workshop, we solicit submissions both on approaches and models for diversity, the evaluation of diverse search results, and on appli
